ABSTRACT

This course was part of a tutorial focusing on the
state of computational semantics, i.e., the state of work on natural
language within the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm. The
discussion in the course centered on the philosophers Richard
Montague and Ludwig Wittgenstein. The course was divided into three
sections: (1) Introduction— discussing trends in the philosophy of
language in regard to the role and importance of formalization, and
describing and giving some history of the three fundamental notions
of logical syntax, meta-language, and an "Lsemantic" definition of
truth; (2) Montagues-describing his work on the formalization of
natural language and giving an account of Montague grammar with
examples; and (3) Wittgenstein-^showing how some of his ideas are
relevant to the present s^^^^^ of AI and the way they clash with

the views of the formalist school. The course emphasized the
importance of partial/inductive knowledge in our understanding of
language and concluded that to handle language "formally" on a
computer, it is in no way necessary to accept tenets based on formal
logic. The most fruitful approaches to understanding language are
precisely those not subservient to a powerful logical or semantic
theory. (TL)

SYNOPSIS/COURSE NOTES FOR PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Yorick V7ilks

Those appalled, as I am myself, by the generality of the title
will be relieved to hear right away that I am going to attempt
no more than a^ brisk introduction followed by some detailed,
though not very detailed, discussion of only two philosophers:
Richard Montague and Ludwig Wittgenstein. The effect of those
names may be to provoke the questions of why those particular
two, or isnt that a "sublime to the ridiculous" combination.
My justification will be entirely in terms of the unity that
this whole tutorial is intended to present, namely the state
of Computational Semantics, v/hich means the state of work on
natural language within the Artificial Intelligence paradigm.
All the courses in the tutor i al centre round that focus. In
the case of the philosophers above, I have chosen them not
so much because of the influence they have had on the subject,
which is small, but because I believe that (a) the influence
of Wittgenstein is almost wholly beneficial while that of
Montague is largely malign. Much of what follows will be a
justification of that rather sweeping judgement*

I. INTRODUCTION

Concentrating in this way means that a number of the names
of the great and the good, in v/hat is normally thought of
as the philosophy of language, will not appear. To attempt
to say everything is of course to say nothing. But let me
venture the judgement that we can distinguish two very broad

1

1.2.

trends in the philosophy of language,, as regards the role and
importance of formalization. Broadly speaking, one group of
philosophers have been for it, and for as much of it as pos-
sible, while the other group has been uncompromisingly against
it. With a little stretching of the imagination one can reach
back and assign even the Greek philosophers to one or other of
these groups, it is clear for example that Aristotle was con-
erably more preoccupied by logic than was Plato. But, and here
the assignment breaks down, it is not clear that Aristotle in
his logical work was doing philosophy of language at all: for
he was proposing how language should be used in order to reason
correctly and in particular by menas of the permitted figures^
of the syllogism. He was not proposing those figures as the
"CORRECT STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE" because, of course, his logic
was all expressed in a natural language, rather than in a for-
malization of it. Or, to put it another way, it is not clear
that one can usefully talk about a formalization and its re-
lation to the language it formalizes, until one has a forma-
lization that is at least superficially different from the
language itself.

But by the time we get to Leibniz, in the seventeenth
century, the positive attitude to formalization we are ^
discussing suddenly appears in full bloom . Leibniz was not ^
only a formal logician, he alsD believed that the formalism
he proposed was the real structure of ordinary language, but
without its awkward ambiguities, vaguenesses, and fallacies.
In his more fantastic moments he envisaged the replacement of
ordinary language by this "Universal Characteristic", to the
general improvement of clarity and precision. He went further:
"For once missionaries are able to introduce this universal
language, then will also the true religion, which ' stands in
intimate harmony with reason, be established, and there will
be as little reason to fear any apostasy in the future as to

ERIC

1.3

fear the renunciation of arithmetic and geometry once they have
been learnt". You will see already that the formalist and atti-
tude is not necessarily a dull and small-minded onel

By and large, the two centuries that followed saw this
position sink almost without trace. The important change ^ for
our purposes , came with the rise of formal logic at the turn
of the last centary. It began with the definition of propo-
sitional and general logic and the investigation of their pro-
perties. The earliest account of these calculi in English is
Whitehead and Russells's Principia Ma the ma tic a in which stey
were applied to the formalization of the notion of mathematical
proof, but already Russell at least was ^tting out the ways in
which this approach to logic was also, for him, a formalization
of natural language. Like Leibniz, he wished to clear away what
he thought of as the confusions of ordinary language. He was
much exercised by the grammatical similarity of sentences like
"Tigers are existent" and "Tigers are fierce" and how, in his
view, this similarity had led philosophers into the error of
thinking that tigers therefore had a proper ty of existence as
well as one of fierceness.

In the First order Predicate Calculus, as it is now called,
the first sentence might go into some form such as Bx.Tx, to be
read as "there exists some thing x such that it is a tiger",

while the second might go into some form such -as Ax,Tx ,

to be read as "for all thinga^x, if x is a tiger then it is
fierce". The important thing here ^ and there are many alterna-
tive forms for these sentence codings )/ is that in none of them
is there any predicate letter for "exists", in the way there is
for tigerness or fierceness. Or to put it another way, the
assertions of existence are always in the part before the dot,
in what is called the quantifiers of the expression. There is
never anything about existence in the body of the expression, to

1.4.

ERIC

the right /fp the dot. And so, in the predicate calculus, the
similarity of form between the two English sentences completely
di sappear s .

Russell was not philosophically neutral about all this, for
he believed that serious intellectual errors had followed from
the "confusion" of the two grammatical forms. One classical
argument about God's existence, for example, centred round the
question as to whether a perfect being (i.e. God) had to have the
property of existence if he was to be perfect. In Russell's
view one could not reasonably talk about the "property of exi#
stence" at all once had seen that the two forms of sentence
above did not both translate into "property forms" in his logic.

Wittgenstein was clotely associated with Russell at the
period I am describing, between 1910 and 1920, and was devel-
oping what is now thought of as his early philosophy. This V7as
set out in a curious work called the Tractatus Logico-Philos-
ophicuas, and I will not be discussing it in any detail h^e7
for whan I come to Wittgenstein I want to talk only about his
late philosophy. It is now faschionable to deny that there is
really a strong difference between a late and an early Wittgen-
stein, but there can bo no doubt that there appears to be this^
distinction. In that early work he proposed what is now called
the "picture theory of truth", in which sentences in ordinary
language signify because their structure reflects or exhibits,
the same relation as that which holds between the things men-
tioned by the sentences. Thus, a logical form of fact like
"catONmat" would be true if the relation between the entity
symbols "cat" and "mat", and the relational symbol "ON", ref-
lected the relation between the appropriate entities in the
world. The problems for Wittgenstein's commentators (including
himself) have always been (a) about what "reflected" could
mean there, which might be clear if the relational symbol was

1 a

and "caf ^was to the left of "mat", on the page and
so the sentence wo|ld be true if the real cat was indeed to
^the left of the reid mat. However, none of the above was so
clear if the relations were mere complex and realistic such

^"'^^ "hat the "entities in the world" were

that the symbols referred to. It seemed clear that Wittgenstein
did not mean the real objects out there in the world, like the
cat and the mat themselves. He used the word "Gegens tande " and
no one has ever been quite clear what these entities were to
be. His theory of meaning at this point was more obscure than
those of Russell, or Russells' predecessor.

Frege had had a "dualist- theory of meaning in which each
word signified, if it did signify, in two ways: one way (Be-
deutung), referred to some entity, and one (Sinn) to" the sense
of the word. The details of this distinction have preoccupied
philosophers ewer since, but the broad outline is dear. His
famous example of "the Morning Star" and "the Evening star-
is still the best illustration: those phrases mean something
different in that they have different SENSES, however it is
also the case that they refer to the same entity or REFERENT.
These of meaning theories need not detain us as we pass on,
all that should be noted is that they are all referential ,
even when they talk of "sense", that is to say, whatever the
status or nature of the thing that is "the meaning", it is an
entity that is somehow pointed a t by the word, m Frege's case
the word points in two different ways to two quite different
sorts of entity, that is all.

Two Ideas surfaced in Wittgenstein's early work that were
to be very important in the logic of the Twenties: first the
notion of Significant and insignificant combination. For him
the symbols for. the Gegenstande could only be substituted
into these picture forms of fact in certain ways and not others.

That is to say ^'Socrates is Mortal" reflected some relation
of entities in the real //orld, but ''Mortality is Socrates"
did not, and not because those entities were not in that
relation, but because the symbols "Mortality" and "Socrates"
coidd not be substitued in that particular representation of
fact at all since the combination made no sense, Anoth^er
important notion was that in the theory of picture forms of
fact Wittgenstein was putting forward the idea, even though
hazily, that a' theory of meaning required a theory of truth,
because the way in which the combination of symbols reflected,
or failed to reflect, a fact (i.e. was true or false) was th^
same thing, in some sense, as the way the form of fact made
sense. It made sense only in so far as. it reflected or failed
to reflect a fact. In particular, he developed a very elem-
entary theory of truth for the propositional calculus, a meht
method called "truth tables", discovered independently the
same time by C.S. Piece in the United States.

This notion is important for what follows so let me just
set it out quickly here: the Propositional Calculus contains
variables like p.q etc. that stand for the proposition espres-
sed by any simple sentence such as: "John is happy". These
simple propositions can be made into more complex one by mean0
of connectives NOT, AND OR and IMPLIES. Those who have
attended Eugene Charniak's course will have seen these connec-
tives already, as well as a simple proof of one expression in
the calculus from others. That is, the proposition proved,
(( POR Q) IMPLIES (O OR P)) was derived by a four-step proof
(see EC's notes). However, there is a quite different way of
establishing the truth or falsity of that compound proposition,
namely by the truth tables. Each of the connectives can be
defined by a table :

8 .

1-7.

Q PIMPLIES Q P OR Q Q OR P (P OR O) IMPLIES (Q OR P)

T T T T

T F p T

P T T T

P P T P

The first column is the table for IMPLIES, the second and third
for OR and the last column for the expression (P OR Q) IMPLIES
(Q OR P). To the left of the vertical line we have the only

four possible truth combinations of P and Q together were

truth combination are expressed in terms of T for "true"
P for "false".

T
T
T
P

T
T
T
T

The first column defines the meaning fo IMPLIES as that which
is true unless its first entity is T and the second P. Similarly,
the second and third columns define OR as that which is always
true unless one of the constituent intems is false, i.e. it is
always T except on the bottom line where- both P and Q are P. Now
we can construct the column for the complex expression from the
columns- for the simples ones. We already know that an IMP3DIES
expression is true except when the first entity in it is T and
the second P. The first entity is the whole of (P OR Q) and we
can see that it is 1 only F when P is P, and Q is P (the bottom
line). But when that is so the right hand entity in the IMPLIES
pair/ namely (Q OR P), is F, hence we find ourselves writing
^ every place in the column for the complex expression. Hence
it is true for all possible combinations of truth values, and
that is what is meant by logically true.

9

Thus we have stablished the truth of the expression by a
completely different method; and this difference of methods
is very important in v/hat follows: Tet us refer to the
method in Charniak's paper as proof theoretic or syntactic
(it comes from the sequential relation of structures in a
proof) , and the second just demonstrated as semantic .

That last word is so troublesome that it cannot be in-
troduced into these notes without a word of warning, because
on its ambiguities rests much of the difficulty of our whole
subject. But notice that, as I have used it there, and will ^
use it in the next pages, it does not mean what it does in
the tittle of the Tutorial Course. I will emphasise this by
writing it "Lsemantic" when I use it in connexion with formal
logic, .as now.

I have introduced two of the three fundamental ideas on
which the formal logic of the Twenties rest. That logic, in
the hands of Tarski and Carnap in particular, is the centre
of the background to this philosophy course, because the
two authors to be discussed in detail represent respectively
a reaction to and an extension of that logic. The three
fundamental notions that I shall now turn to, are logical ^
syntax, me ta- language and a Lsemantic definition of truth.

Carnap in his "Logical Syntax of Language" developed in a
systematic way the notion of "ill-formed expression" that we
met earlier in discussing "Mortality is Socrates". Carnap
distinguished, for any logic, its rules of formation and rules

of transformation (those who think this is beginning to sound
, familiar should* remember that Chomsky v/as many years later a
student of Carnap). The rules of formation determined what were,,
and were not , well- formed expressions in the logical language
so that; in the Proposi tional Calculus (P IMPLIES (OR Q) ) was

ERIC ±yj

1.9.

not, while (P OR Q) was, a well-formed expression. The rules
of transformation then operated on those well-formed expres-
sion that were true to produce theorems in the logic. Carnap
was a formalizer in the Leibnizian sense, for, to him, these
distinctions applied to an ideal formalization of natural
language, and in the book I referred to he tried to construct
one for natural language. Carnap distinguished two iypes of
what he called "pseudo-statement":

(1) Caesar is and

(2) Caesar is a prime number

The first was counter-syntachi n m that the last word came
from the wrong part~of-speech category. The second was syn-
tactically correct but violded the rules of logical syntax. The
details of all this now seem a little primitive but it was clear
what he was after. In his system he also distinguished between
an object- and meta-language . So, if (i) above was a syntactical-
ly correct statement in the object language (what Carnap called
Language I)., then (3) Sentence (1) is syntactically correct
and

(4) in sentence (1) "Caesar" occurs immediately before "is" are
both statements in the metalanguage, or Language II. Carnap was

far from dispassionate in all this, in that his purpose was what
Russell's had been, to do away with certain kinds of sentence,
and particularyl those that arose in certain kinds of philos-
ophical writing, by showing that they violated the rules of
logical syntax. The language me ta-language distinction did not
arise from any consideratiors about the structure of natural
language, but was Tarski's solution, or rather part of it, to
an apparently intractable problem of logic that he had inheri-
ted from Russell, who had discovered certain logical paradoxes.
Tarski's statement of the problem wcls often in terms of the
example :

11

ERJC

I.IO.

THE SENTENCE IN THIS RECTANGLE IS FALSE

where any attempts to assign a truth-value to the sentence
lead to trouble. Tarski thought that this problem would
be solved if we only used "true" in a metalanguage and
never in an object language. Thus "That John is happy is
true" would be a sentence with level confusion, for the
proper form would be the metalanguage sentence "'John is
happy* i? true", where the sentence "John is happy" is.
mentioned in the metalanguage sentence but not used in it.

Tarski 's fundamental achievement was a theory of truth
and logical consequence for formalised languages, or ^v^hat
in our convention we may call a Lsemantic theory.

Like many apparently revolutionary theories, Tarski 's
is in fact a systematisation of ideas that had existed for a
long time. It used to be conventional to say that classical
logic did not have a theory of truth, that it was wholly syn-
tactic^ or proof- theo^tic • That is to say that Aristotle's
syllogistic gave no more than forms of inference, such that
one form was derivable from another, by rule, in the manner
of the Propositional Calculus derivation in EC's notes that
I re^ferr.e'a'l^o. There was, this view goes, nothing analogous
to the truth table method that I described, because all syl-
logistic is of the general form.

CONCLUSION

such as:

Some Panthers are not Mammals

12

1.11.

Some Mammals are not Swans
and so

Some Panthers are not Swans.

On this view , logical deriv ability is independent of meaning ,
in that it is of no importance what -i^s— pxit in place of the
words "Panther" "Swan" and "Mammal".

However/ this view is not correct, and it was known in
ancient times that the last line did not follow from the
other two / and for the folio v/ing' reason: suppose we replace
"Panther" 'Swan" and "Mammal" by "Pig" "Swine** and "Mammoth"
respectively. Then we get the following inference form (where
as before the line denotes the inference)

Some Pigs are not Mammoths
Some Mammoths are not Swine
Some Pigs are not Swine .
>

Here the premisses are true and the conclusion clearly false,
so the new conclusion cannot follow from the nev; premisses,
and so the old conclusion does not follow from the old prem-
isses. This fact was known in ancient times, and by this
totally non-proof theoretic method: one in which the meanings
of "Pig" "Swine" and "Mammoth" were e ssential to the demon-
stration .

One might say, at the risk of enormous simplif icEtion , that
Tarski's theory of consequence and truth is a systematic
generalisation of this notion, of Leibniz's slogan "Logical
truth is truth in all possible worlds" and of the truth-
table notion that the logical truth of compoind espressions
is to be settles in terms , and only in terms, of the truth-
conditions of the simpler propositions of which they are
constructed.

1 3

1,12.

One could say that the heart of Tarski's Lsemantics is his
very general definition of logical consequence , and his very
general definition of logical truth as a special case. The
questions that then arise for tecnical logicians are how far
this definition of consequence is the same as (or) "equipollent
with in the tecnical vocabulary) the proof- theoretic one and,
for our purposes, how this definition of truth is to be explain
ed. Here are Tar ski's own definitions:

Let L be any class of sentences. We replace all extra-
logical constants which occur in the sentences belonging ^
to L by corresponding varicibles, like constants being re-
placed by like variables, and unlike by unlike. In this
way we obtain a class L' of sentential functions. An ar-
bitrary sequence of objects v/hich satisfies every senten-
tial function of the class L' will be calles a model or
realization of the class L of sentences (in just this

sense one usually speaks of models of an axiom system of
a deductive theory) . If in peirticular the class L con-
sists of a vSingle sentence X, we shall also call the
model of the class L the model of the sentence. X.
In terms of these concepts we can define the concept of
logical consequence as follows:

The sentence X follov/s logically from the sen-
tences of the class K if, and only if, every
model of the class K j.s also a model of the
sentence X.

i

V7e can agree to call a class of' sentences contradictory
if it possesses no model- Analogously a class of sen-
tences can be called analytical if ever^" sequence of ob-
jects is a model of it. Both, of tliese concepts can be
related not only to classes of sentences but also to

single sentances We can also show that those

and only those sentences are analyticaj^ which follow
from every class of sentences (in particular from the
empty class) cind only those contradictory from which
eveiry sentence follov/s.

So we can see that the wholo "Panthers, Mammals, Swans" ar-
gument cannot be analytic (i.e. logically true) on Tarski " s
definition because we found a sequence of objects (i.e. a
Pig, a Mammal, and a Swan) that was not a model for it.

' 14

1.13

Notice immediately that this definition of analytic, or logic-
ally true, in terms of all models is in a clear sense., a genera-
lisation of the notion illustrated by the truth tables earlier in
terms of all distribution of trutz values. Moreover, an important
notion has been introduced, under a number of different names?
mode_l, sequence/ possible world - or realization , and it will
appear again under the name interpretation . This notion is impor-
tant in what follows when these notions are applied to natural
language, and the reason the notion of "sequence" appears in
Tarski's definition is because these definition were not framed
for language at all, but for mathematics, so when Tarski speaks
of "sequence" he is thinking essentially of a sequence of numbers,
and in particular the sequence of integers. The word "sentence"
in the above definitions should not confuse you into thinking that
it is natural language that is being talked about.

Let us turn to another important family of Tarskian notions?
.those of truth definition and truth condition. The truth condi-
tions of a sentence are, unsurprisingly, the conditions under
which it is true, and the truth definition of a sentence is the
specification of its truth conditions. The usual illustrative
statement of the definition of truth is

"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white.
This is a sentence, in a meta language, of the truth condition
of a sentence in an object language. It is not quite as trivial
as it might appear at first sight, as can be seen by putting a
German sentence in the quoted sentence space:

"Schnee ist weiss" is true if and only if aiow is white
This can now be seen to be an empirical truth about a German sen-
tence, one that might easily have been false. Moreover, this def-
inition cannot be generalised trivially as

"X".is true if and only if X,
because the whole point of the language-metalanguage distinction

15

1.14a

is that the first item in the sentences above is NO MORE THAN
THE NAME OF THE X SYMBOL. Also,oof course, .the version above
in English is misleading because, as we saw; for Tarski a
li ^uage cannot be a metalanguage for itself (i.e. we cannot
have the same natural language inside and outside the quota-
tion marks in the truth definition) , because that was what
gave rise to the truth paradoxes like the rectangle example.
Truth definition, then, can only be in a metalanguage.*

The "Snow is white*, example above can appear vacuous for
other reasons too, of course, and it is perhaps a little unfair
to start with it, although this is nearly always done. In an
ideal Tarskian "theory of truth" sentences like the one above:

"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is ,
white, would appear as ultimate consequences: the final deductions
from a set of truth axioms. On the way there would be more sub-
stantial looking truth conditions such as (to use an example
Davidson gave for a famous tricky sentence of Bar-Hillies)

'"The box was in the pen" is true for an English
speaker, at time t if and only if either the box was in the
playpen before t and the circumstances surrounding x at t meet
condition c (whatever that mey be yw) , OR the box was in the
writing pen before t and the circumstances surrounding x at t
meet condition c'.'

Lastly, the "Snow" definition above is a definition of the

truth conditions of the sentence "Snow is white": it is not to

be considered a definition of the concept truth itself, though

it would be in principle if such me ta- statements were set out

for all possible object sentences. That would be what might be

called a definition of truth itself by extension, or by complete

listing, as we might say. However, it would still be open to the

charge of triviality, in that it lacks recursiveness (or calcul-

. ability!

16

ERLC

1.14b

Let us see, in a tiny fragment, how recursiveness is to be
put in. But for that v/e need two more notions, satisfac-
tion and assignment.

Suppose we were to create a truth definition for a tiny
fragment of Predicate Logic- We would have constant a: es
like a, bj etc.; variables like x, y, z> predicates like
P/ G, R and the existential quantifier E. We would first
define "sentence" or "formal expression" in the Predicate
Calculus fragment, which would tell us that Rx was an ex-
pression. These rules would be what were called formation
rules when we discussed Carnap: they do not tell you what
is true but what is well- formed . We now encounter the one
key notion of satisfactio n: it is much like "true of"
in ordinary language. So running is true of John ("John"
satisfies the predicate "Runs", which we write R j ) when
and only when John runs. We would then get what is called
a recursive definition of truth for the fragment in terms
of the notion of an assignment g. Let us say an expression
Rx is satisfied bz an assignment g if and only if g(x) runs*
An assignment is therefore a function which given a variable
X which picks out an actual entity in a domai n here the do-
main of people, and assigns it to the variable. So g(x )
is a person picked out in this way, and if g(x) actually
runs then Rx is satisfied by trhat assignment, or to put
it the other way, is true-under-that-assignment . The
whole thing is rounded off with a recursive definition
of truth for the fragment as follows: A sentence is true
if and only if it is satisfied by all assignments in the

Before you wonder what all this could possibly be for,
let me make a fev7 general points about it. The notion of
satisfaction is the one that is like our ordinary notion
of "true*', and like, the ascription of value T to an ele-
mentary sentence in the truth tables of the Proposi tional
Calculus. The Tarskian notion ''true" AS JUST DEFINED ABOVE
is much more like the notion logic ally true in the Propo-
sitional Calculus: in the sense in which (A or B) IMPLIES
(B OR A) was shown to be logically true. The notion of
truth defined above (in "snow is white" and in the recursive
definition) is normally called absolute truth by Tarskians,
and has analogies with that of analytici ty defined above
by Tarski himself in the passage I quoted. That is to
say, a sentence is analytic if true for all models f or
all sequences of items, or, as for Leibniz, in all possible
worlds .

There is something very odd about this notion of Tar-
ski's, in particular because it does not seem to draw the
common sense distinction between that something that just
happens to be true, like "Lugano is in Switzerland", and
something that has to be true like the Proposi tional Cal-
culus statement above. Tarski himself was aware of this,
and that, if the logical constants (i.e. or, implies, etc.)
were chosen in non-obvious ways then any set of sentences
whatever could be the analytic sentences of a system of
logic. He accepted this consequence quite calmly. Troubles
with the notion of absolute truth have caused those who
want to apply Tarski 's notions to natural language, like
Montague, (and it is useful to remember that Tarski did

18

1. 16

not think they could be applied to natural language) , to
shift to the notion of "truth relative to a model" as the
standard sense of "true", and not that of "true" as defined
in the recursive truth definition above (truth for all as-
signments). This involves giving up what Tarski called
"Convention T" , roughly that there was a basic sense of
truth independent of particular models, sequences, inter-
pretations, and sticking only to the notion of "truth
within a model"or interpretation, or what is usually called
a relat ivistic notion of truth . It is this notion that
Montague works with when discussing natural language, and
this issues only in relativistic truth difinitions (giving
"satisfaction conditions") rather than a full-blooded
Tarskian truth definition and truth condtions. Thus,
the corresponding clause to the one above, in a relative
definition would contain the notion of I, an interpreta-
tion, or model, and v/ould read:

Rx is true, in interpretation I if and only if,' for
every • assignment g, Rx is true-wi th-respect- to-g in I.
All very heavy weather to make, you may think, but it is
in fact the whole basis* of Montague's semantics of natural
language that I shall turn to very shortly. '

Let me make two points in concluding this section:

Although Montague is the best known logician seeking
to apply these general notions to natural language in
detail , there is a school of logicians sharing general
principles concerning the applicability of Tarksi-like
theories to natural language. The thesis that they share
in particular is that of the "truth theory of meaning":

10

1.17

namely that the meaning of a sentence is determined by
its truth conditions, in the Tarskian sense of that phrase.
It would be quite possible to reject Montague's detailed
"Semantics for Natural Language" and still accept the gen-
eral tenets of this s chool about meaning and truth , namely
that truth conditions determine the meaning of the sentences
of natural language in just the way that they can be said
to do'so/ in Tarski ' s theories^ for the sentences of logic
and mathematics.

I shall not tackle this thesis head on in these lectures:
it will be raised indirectly in what I have to say about
Wittgenstein, in that his later philosophy can be thought
of as in direct opposition to this view. The main figure
in the group holding this thesis is Donald Davidson, and
those who are interested in the general principle should
read Davidson*s articles:

"Truth and meaning" Synthese , 1967.
"Semantics for Natura languages" in Linguaggi nella
societa e nella tecnica , Edizione de Commune, Milano,1970.

and two very lucid replies

P. P. Strawson "Meaning and Truth" Oxford U. P., 1971.'

(in terms of speech acts)
and

M. Dummett, "The Justification of Deduction" British
Academy, 1975, in terms of a highly ingenious Wittg'^n-

steinian argument .

20

1.18

Secondly, the " truth- condition" approach following
Tarski, should not be confused with the claims of a move-
ment contemporary with Tarski, that of the logical posi -
t ivists . They also had a thesis about the dependence of
meaning on truth and it is easy to confuse it with the
truth condition approach. Their principle was called
the Principle of Verification ^ and it said "The meaning
of a statement is the procedures we would carry out to
establish its truth or falsehood". I shall refer to this
principle when discussing Montague later, in order to claim
that however wrong this principle might be (and it is wrong)
it was at least serious, in a way that the mod'ern truth
condition approach is not.

Before going to the meat of the course, let me make a
disclaimer at this point. I have contrasted, at some
length, the formalist view of natural language with some
other, undefined, approach, and we have ended up here
with some more detailed description of the high point of
the formalist approach, namely Montague. I would not want
a reader to think at this point that, in criticising
Montague, as I intend to, and to some extent espousing
the views of the later Wittgenstein, I am in any sense
opposing the f ormal,^Analysi^e-?,i5f natural language. Given
the nature of this Institute that would be an absurd posi-
tion. I am opposing what I" think of as pointless formali-
zations of natural language, and arguing that Wittgenstein
is one of the few philosophers who can provide insights
into what a fruitful approach to natural language might
be like.

I must tread carefully here because Wittgenstein was
a foe of all attempts to apply formal logic to the analysis

21

1.19

and understanding of natural language and, moreover/ the
philosopher Dreyfus, a full--tiine opponent of the very possi-
bility of artificial intelligence, has made much use of
Wittgenstein's arguments against formal logic in his own
arguments against AI-I believe Dreyfus to be mistaken on
this, and will argue that in detail later, in that I do not
think that Wittgenstein's salvoes against formal logic can-
simply be turned round and aimed at AI- On the contrary,
and this is, I think, the real philosophical importance
of AI, and the reason v/hz it is a, Wi ttqensteinian activity .
AI has completely changed the old debate between formalists
and anti- formalists . For, to handle language "formally"
on a computer, it is in no way necessary to accept the
tenets ^of Tarski, Montague or any other approach based on
formal logic. On the contrary, and as you will see argued
in detail in other courses, the most fruitful approaches
to understanding language are precisely those not subser-
vient to a powerful logical or semantic theory.

Thus, it is, I would claim, that AI has provided a sense
to the notion of the precise manipulation of language
(and anything computable must be procise of course) that
is not necessarily open to the attacks of the anti- formalists
( = anti-f ormal'-logicians) like V7i ttgenstein . I will argue
this below, but in conclusion I think it should be said
that a large part of the credit for breaking the old
f ormalist/anti-f ormalist opposition in a new way, must
go to Chomsky

Chomsky's theory of transformational grammar, whatever
its drawbacks, is certainly a precise theory of language:
it also has the form of a logic, but, and here is the key
originality, not the content . One way of describing

22 ^

1. 20

transformation grammar (a non-standard but I think revealing
way) , is to say that Chomsky took the structure of proof-
theretic logic (what Carnap you will remember called trans-
formation rules) namely the repeated derivation of structures
from other structures by means of rules of inference , but
he let its content be no more than what Carnap had meant
by Formation Rules , namely the separation of the V/ell-f ormed
from the ill--formed. Thus, in transformational grammar
the inference (=transf ormational ) rules were to apply to
axioms and theorems (^kernels etc.)f but to produce not
new theorems but English sentences well-formed.

Thus / Chomsky had a precise system of handling language
to propose (which at one stage even seemed computable) ,
but which had no semantic definition of truth, and not
even a syntactic, proof-theoretic, one either. For the
notion of truth never came into the matter at all. Thus,
I would claim that Chomsky's was the first concrete propo-
sal to breach the wall between formal and anti-formal ap-
proaches, where "formal" refers to truth and not to pre-
cision. In all this AI has gone considerably further , and
indeed Chomsky's paradigm still has many of the obvious
drawbacks to formal approaches that I discuss here: and
in particular the rigid "derivational'* structure of proofs,
and Chomsky an transformational derivations .

23

2 MONTAGUE

I argued just now that Chomsky's transformational grammiar
could be sean as a move to preserve the advantages of forn^ali
cation, but without its "logicism"- MOntague saw his task,
quite clearly, as reversing that move: he explicitly began
papers by saying that he intended to tackle the formalization
of natural language in a way more serious than what he
called "the developments emanating from MIT",

There is an initial expositional problem v/ith MOntague' s
work+ most people who read it find it incomprehensible.
For this reason it is far simpler to follow one of the more
lucid expositions of his work, due to Barbara Partee, or
Dov Gabbay. The most comprehensible of Montague's papers
is almost certainly "English as a formal language" in the
Linguaggi volume, refered to earlier in connexion with
Davidson. That book is a good one to have, by the way,
and is obtainable FREE bz writing to the Olivetti Corp, ,
Milano, Italia,

Barbara Partee 's paper is "Montague Grammar and Transforma-
tional Grammar", It will appear in Lingui stic Inquiry
in 1975., and until then is obtainable from her for $US 3,00
at Linguistics, Univ of Massachusetts, Amherst, Mass, USA-
Gabbay's paper, to which my account is closest, is called
"Representation of the MOntague semantics as a form of the
Suppes semantics" and appears in Hintikka, Suppes & Moravcsik
(eds) Approaches to Natural Language . (1973)

The account I shall give here of Montague grammar is
unfair to it, and it could not be sketched adequately in
the time and space available. All I can try to do is
give some inkling of the basic mechanism that drives it,
and motivates its practitioners. The best way is to follow

24

1.22

out the analysis of a sentence of Montague's, one that he
claimed was not adequately treated by transformational
grammar, and indeed could not be so treated. By that he
meant sentences like " Every man loves some woman" which,
to a logician have two quite different readings, and cor-
responding to each is a different truth condition. The
"readings" of the sentence are taken to be

(i ) f o,r every man there is some woman that he loves .

(ii) there is some woman such that every man loves her.
Let us leave aside here the question as to whether or

not such a sentence REALLY is ambiguous to a normal speaker
of the language, that is whether or ndt a speaker has to
have some acquaintance with the notionS'^of formal logic
in order to see that there is a reading (ii) at all. Let
us also leave aside the question as to whether recent work
in Generative Semantics has brought such logical ambiguities
within the compass ofj^^enerati ve linguistics.

There are two other ingredients that must be added at
this point. It is an assumption of not only MOntague, but
of all those associated with the "is meaning truth" move-
ment, that a semantics must show how the truth conditions
of complex expressions are built up out of the truth
conditions of their parts. That is to say, the basic scheme
of analysis will be the construction of a formal semantic
entity equivalent to the (truth condition of a sentence)
from semantic items associated with the words that make up
the seni-ence. Secondly, the form of the construction of this
semantic entry will follow the syntactic analysis of the
sentence.

In what follows I stick closely to Gabbay's version,
which is much simpler than Montague's, although Gabbay

25

1.23

shows the formal equivalence of his schema and Montague's.
Moreover, Gabbay concentrates on a single construction,
whereas Montague is always so busy settling little formal
points in 'an elegant way that it is easy to lose the main
thrust of his argument. Montague's own system is set up on
the basis of a categorial grammar, whereas Gabbay's is based
on the more familiar, but formally equivalent notion of a
phrase structure grammar. with each word category is as-
sociated both a syntatic type, that enables a phrase stru-
cture tree to be set up in a more-or-less conventional
way, and a semantic type. The process consists in combin-
ing semantic types node-by-node up the syntactic tree so
as to reach a single semantic item at the top. This item
is then an expression of the truth- conditions of the whole
sentence.

Let us start with the syntactic categories, and take
only those we need' for the example sentences (i) and (ii) .
S = sentence

IV = intransitive verb = (run, etc.)
TV = transitive verb = (love, etc.)
CN = common noun = (nan, woman,...)
Ql = universal quantifier = (every)
Q2 = existential quantifier = (some)
we also need a derived category
NP = noun phrase.

The rules of the phrase structure grammar for our purposes
are simply:

S ^ NP + IV

IV > TV + NP

S > IV + NP

IV > NP + TV

NP Ql + CN

. NP ^ Q2 + CN

20

Now we turn to the semantic part, which requires the notion

of I^, the set of possible worlds or interpretations , and,

if J is the number of instants of time, wg have a set IXJ*

possible worlds in all: each labelled by an ordered pair of

variables (i,j). D is the domain of individuals living in

these worlds. Let us think of them as people, for this

sentence, and as the same people in all the worlds., with

each sentence item, whose syntactic category was given

earlier, we shall now associate a semantical category giving

its "meaning", which will be written as vertical bars round

the word(s). Thus "John" is the name of a person, and with

it we associate an element in the domain called il John i I ,

written iljohn II D. This is oversimple and we will actually
lilt

treat MJohn 1 I as a set containing just John, so as the make
fJohn tlof the same type as Ijjohn and Maryll. This is far
simpler than MOntague, who treates John as a set of his
properties, but the formal points will remain the same.

Running will be a property of people and 1 1 run j | will be
a function that gives for each world (i,j) the set of those
who run, i.e. || run 1| i , j Q, D . Similarly Hlove H i , j C».DXD
and is a list of who loves whom in world (i, j), i.e. a
list of ordered pairs.

* "X" denotes the cross-product of two sets. If we have
sets, (i, ij./ i^^ and (j, jj, J^., J^) then the cross-

product is the set of all possible pairs like <Cij. j^.^.
If one set has n things and the other has m, then there
will be n X m pairs in the cross-product, where "X" means
multiplied by .

ERIC

!• 26

There are two more sorts of rules:
one defines the properties of \\ II by showing the correspon-
dence between the syntactic and semantic assignments, so we
get rules, in Gabbay ' s numbering, where as before^ is to be
read is a member of, Sis to be read is contained in, and
j J is to be read the set such that.

(I) X C IV =:>^X li i j Q D
(5) X e CN =>1|-^ ||ij

(II) Hevery ll(Do) = {eU'^Do}
for some domain Do D

Ql => H every II (Do) = E [ E O Doj

Q2 => 11 some !l (Do) = { E j E Do jZ^J

What we do now is to "climb up" the structured trees
using another set of rules that combine these semantical
objects in a predetermined way. For any node dominating
two lower nodes like this:.

s t

we can construct the semantical object kr at r from the
objects at kt at t and ks at s. These combination rules
correspond one to one with the syntactic rules, and this
correspondence is simply givenMi^e. not itself constructed
by a higher rule). So,, we could set out two example syn-
tactic rules that we have already encountered alongside
the corresponding semantic combination rules, where, in
each cdse, the lef t*^ hand side of the syntactic rule refers
to the syntactic category at node r, and the two syntactic
categories on the right-hand-side refer to the categories
at s and t respectively.

' ■ 29

1.27

NP — ^ Ql + CN Kr = Kt (Ks) r for each (irj)

S — ^ NP + IV for each Kr is T if and only

if (Kt Ks) otherwise false.

To interpret these semantic combination rules you
must realise that they do not assert inclusion of syntac-
tic categories (i.e. the first semantic rule does not
mean the application of CN to Ql at all, but the applica-
tion of the semantic object at the same node as CM to the
semantic object at the same node as Ql . So Ks will be
an Isemantical object corresponding to an Ql entitz, namely
a function as in rule ( ) picking out all sets in the
domain that contain "all of some sort of thing" , while
CN will be the sort of thing in question , say , men or
women. Then the result of the application will be sets
containing, say, all the men in the domain.
Here are Gabbay's own applications of these rules, and
others of the san^e form to construct the items up the
trees (i) and (ii) +

*To be righthand side read as "the set of all things
E such that the set overlap (intersection) of E and Do
is not empty".

30

1. 28

In order to understand this labelling it is important
to grasp the functional "selection" of en€ities that it

of all things in the domain that a loves .

There is really no more to the basic idea than this:
namely the cons.truction of alsemantical object that
states what it is, in set- theoretic termsr for the cor-
responding reading of some sentence to be true. The
advantage of the Gabbay-Suppes Isemantics over the one
Montague presents is not just its theoretical simplicity,
but that it jgets over one ma.j-or fault pf tlie Montague
systemjthat all "logically false" sentences have the same
representation. This is very counter-intuitive, for we
feel fairly sure that, WHATEVER "I have proved the com-
pleteability of arithmetic" and "This is a round triangle
mean, thGy certainly don't mean the same. In the Gabfoay
system, the "meaning'' of a sentence can be identified,
not just with the semantical object found, but with the
constructive process of assigning it up the syntactic
tree. In that way Gabbay claims, two "logically false"
sentences with the same Isemantical object at the top
of the tree can be said to "mean something different"
because of the two tree-construction processes that gave
rise to them.

I have hardly s^et out anisemantic theory in enough .
detail to justify any detailed criticism, yet nonetheless
the main outlines are there, and I think I can sketch
out the form that criticism should take. (what follows

i; 29

(1) One could argue that the syntax. is arbitrary and
unmotivated. There are indeed two syntactic readings for
the sentence, which is what was wanted , but no one given
two tree diagrams could guess WHICH CORRESPONDED TO WHICH
reading; There will also, of course, be two readings for
"Every man loves ice cream'S to no particular purpose.

(2) The Isemantics is entirely reflected from the
syntax aad the two could not in principle diverge. This
seems extraordinary, and very implausible. Consider what
will happen with the Chomsky examples "John is easy to
please" and "John is eager l:o please". (Partee and those
who think like her, that transformations and Isemantics
can be fused, would probably argue here that this will be
cleared up in a joint system.)

(3) The assumptioa^at every stage is that there is

a molecular confrontation between language and the world.
This seems plausible enough perhaps for 'John loves Mary'
but wildly improbable for sentences whose meaning is ex-
plained by their inferential structure to other sentences.
I will return to this in the next ^section, but consider
how far it is from any AI , or "frames", view of meaning,'
on which we cannot talk about meaning independently of
large structures of knowledge existing, a^. it were, out-
side the sentence examined. There is no pUce for that
in Montague's system because meaning is tn be built up
only from simple:; Isemantical objects, att^.;hed to the
items of the sentence directly.

(4) We can contrast the triviality of the Isemantic
view with the seriousness of what I earlier called the
logical positivist view of -meaning, that what a senSence
means is the procedures we would carry out to see if it

1.30

was true. A logical positivist, faced with a difficult
sentence like "God is good" might talk about what conceiv-
able observations would be relevant to checking up on,
and so giving meaning to it. But on an Isemantic view the
meaning comesdown in the end to some structure like
(True if and only if "God" is in the class of "Good things") ,
indicating that truth conditions a trivialisation of a
serious empirical notion .

(5) Is the notion of " truth- condition" computable?
In a clear sense it is not, in that there is a possible world
corresponding to every real fraction of an inch. by which
I am taller than Napoleon, say, and so there is at least
a denumerable infinity of possible worlds in which "Wilks
is taller than Napoleon" is true. Computing over them
would clearly be no joke. Even were some contraction,
possible it is hard to see that the notion of a "class
of things that run" is a useful form of manipulable in--
formation about the world. Again procedures have to be
represented by static sets in Isemantics. Consider "8
is greater than 5". To establish the truth of that with
computer we would do a calculation. In Isemantics we
would have to search the set GREATERTHAN which CONTAINS
ALL POSSIBLE PAIRS SUCH THAT ONE MEMBER IS GREATER THAN
THE OTHER*. Some set, some computation!

A cynic might say that, whatever the value of Iseman-
tics as a subsequent axiomatisation , or reconstruction,
of linguistic computations , it could never be a research
toolj one in which important rules were established ini-
tially. In the same way^ science is never done by thinking
about the axioms of formal scientific systems. These
notions of Isemantics are all mathematical notions and
belong there. In the world of natural language, they are,
in Wittgenstein's phrase, "on holiday" and cannot be
expected to earn their keep.

3 WITTGENSTEIN

Wittgenstein shares one feature with Montague, that of
being a "difficult" writer. There is no hope of doing more
than taking a number of loosely connected topics, and giving
under each a few basic quotations follov/ed by some small
smount of exposition and some remarks on its relevance to
the present situation in AI or on the way it clashes, where
it does, with the views of the formalist school that I have
just described in some detail. This will do no sort of
justice to Wittgenstein at all; each one of these topics
has already been the subject of a number of articles and
books. The idea is simply to give a flavour, to those
unfamiliar with him, of what vrittgens tein has to offer.

Wittgenstein also had a peculiar style: his work, early
and late, takes the form of a series of numbered remarks .
Some of these were arranged in their present order after his
death (in the early Fifties) by editors. The remarks are
not themselves arranged neatly under headings, and reading
Wittgenstein therefore takes the form of tracing connections
through the remarks for oneself. In what follows I shall
quote mostly from his Philosophical Investigations (and
occasionally from his Philosophical Remarks ) . Both are
available in German-English parallel texts . Those inter--
ested should certainly get hold of a copy of the Investi -
gations and try the style for themselves. I will also
give numbers of additional paragraphs that could be con-
sulted under each topic. (I will use the dollar sign $
before paragraph numbers and p, as is normal, before page,
numbers. The page numbers are the sanie in English and
German editions.) -

34

1.32

The best book on Wittgenstein's later work is probably:
A. J. K:jney, Wittgenstein .

Max Black's "Wittgensteins Philosophy of Language" in his
Margins of Precision is a good introductory essay. Those
interested in seeing how Wittgenstein's arguments can be
turned into an attack on the very notion of Artificial
Intelligence, should look at:
H. Dreyfus, What Computers can't do .

There will be much I shall leave cut including many of
Wittgenstein's other concerns th ^t are very close to those
of AI: understanding and behavious, what it means to model
the brain, whether it makes any sense to talk of "decoding
the brain". I shall not discuss these major issues except
in so far as they relate to language directly. Again, a whole

school of modern philosophy the '^speech act" school

of Grice and Searle is finding a place within modern

linguistics, and also has its genesis in this same work
of Wittgenstein's and his concern with notions of intention
and linguistic performance. That too will have to be left
out .

When reading Wit^tgens tein , a number of unmentioned
presences have to be kept in mind at all times. The major
one is Wittgenstein's early self; and his "picture theory
of truth". Much of the motivation of the Philosophical
Investigations was to set out why that view and its associated
doctrines were wrong. Also in the background are Tarski
and Carnap, who still advocate the formalist view strongly,
long after Wittgenstein had given it up. Most of the views
attacked in PI were held in one form or another by Tarski.
The simple change in Wittgenstein was that^ he had ceased
to believe that words had meaning chiefly becasue they

1.33

pointed at things, and that sentences v;ore true because
they matched up to the world in some direct one-to-one way.
He became more and more convinced that what was important
about language was its "deep grammatical forms*', and it was
from here that *the metaphor of ''depth*' in modern linguistics
took off. VUttgenstein always resisted any actional attempt
to formulate a theory of these forms, and there is no point
in imagining that he would have been deliriously happy had
he lived to see modern linguistics and A I as alternatives
to the logical paradigm.

But I shall try to show that many of the concerns of mod-
ern AI are already there in his work, and that his line
of thinking is a powerful antidote to the naive errors with
which the subject is still riddled, and hence that McCarthy
a leading practitioner AI was quite wrong in his judgement
that "Wittgenstein set philosophy back 50 years."

Here is an epigraphic quote for all that follows:

„ ^ $ 122. A main source of our failure to

tion is of fundamental significance for us.

of the words "to point to this thing", "to
point to that thing" , and on the other hand
"to point to the colour , njot the shape" ,
"to mean the colour" , and so on.

$ 2. That philosophical concept of meaning
(i.e. of meaning as pointing) has its place
in a primitive idea of the way language
functions. But one can also say that it is
the idea of a language more primitive than ours.

$ 13. When we say : "Every word in language
signifies something" we have so far said nothing
whatever) unless we have explained exactly
what distinction v/e wish to make. (It might
be, of course, that we wanted to distinguish
the words of language (8) from words "without
meaning*' such as occur in Lewis Carroll's
poems , or words like "Lilliburlero" in songs .

$ 30. So one might say: the ostensive
(i.e. pointing to) definition explains the
use--the meaning--of the word when the overall
role of the t^ord in language is clear. Thus
if I know that someone means to explain a
colour-v;ord to me the ostensive definition
"That is called ' sepia '", will help me to
understand the word.—

37

1 . 35

$ 32 . Someone coming into a strange country
v/ill sometimes learn jbho language of the inhabi
tants from ostensive definitions that they
give him> and he will often have to guess the
meaning of these definition? and will guess
ft sometimes right, sometimes wrong.

And now, I think, we can say: (those who
believe in "meaning is pointing" ) describes
the learning of human language as if the child
came into a strange country and did not
understand the language of the country f that
is. as if it already had a language, only not
this one. ' (See aJ,so v$ll and 27)

Comment: Wittgenstein is arguing that pointing or referring
is in principle a vague activity. It can only be made clear
by explaining what wc are point at from within the language ~-
i.e. pointing assumes the whole language, except in the
case of children, and the analogy with them is false ($32).
As always, Wittgenstein says we could have a language based
on the referential notion ($2) , but it would be a language
more primitive than what we call natural language. The re-
lation of this pnint is the referential assumption of both
Montague and many AI v/orkers like Winograd should be obvious.
16 Winograd's case, it is harder to see because of the appeal
to a "Procedural viev/ of meaning". But notice that the
"procedures" in Winograd all depend on the location and
manipulation of some physical object, such as a block. It
is not clear how a Winogradian system could function in a
world that did not consist of locateable, identifiable
objects, such as say, the world of nev;spaper articles, or
these notes.

(ii) Mini languages and language games
Thesis: We can construct mini-languages obeying any

38

1. 36

rules we like, let us think of thera as games , The important
question is whether these games are sufficiently like the
"whole game" of natural language. This question does not
have a definite answer any more than this question "can one
play chess without the Queon?"

Wittgenstein attributes the "pointing view of meaning"
to St. Augustine and proceeds to construct a mini-language
of comma^nds and objects like "bloc}^" "clab"^ and colours
like "red" etc.

$ 2 . Let us imagine a language for which the
description given by Augustine is right. The
language is meant to serve for communication be-
tween a builder A and an assistant B. A is building
with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars,
slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and
that in the order in which A needs them. For
thi s purpose they use a language consisting of
the words ^'block", "pillar", "slab", "beam".
A calls them out;--B brings the stone v/hich
he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call--
Conceive this as a complete primitive language.

3. Augustine, we might say, does describe
a system of communication only jiot everything
that we call language is this system. And one
has to say this in many cases where the question
arises "Is this an appropriate description or
not? " The answer is : "Yes , it is appropriate ,
but only for this narrov/ly circumscribed region ,
not for the whole of what you were claiming to
describe . "

It is as if someone were to say: "A game con-
sists in moving objects about on a surface
accorr.ing to certain rules. ..''--and we replied:
You seem to be thinking of board games, but
there are others. You can make your definition
correct by expressly restricting it to those
games.

' 1.36

Comment:

The mini-language Wittgenstein constructed should sound
familiar to those of you who attended the Parsing survey coursel

At this print I shall v/ant to draw in- the notion of "semantic
primitive" as used in AI and linguistic systems. I shall
argue that they too belong in language games and have an
irreducibly linguistic character. That is to say, semantic
primitives, like MAN/PHYSOB do not refer to real world
objects, or Mind/brain objects either, and it is a theore-
tical mistake to seek to justify them in that v/ay. They
belong in a reduced language, but a langur?.ge nonetheless. I
shall relatle this problem to how we should choose primitives
and to some recent psychological results on "semantic memory".

(iii) Family resemblances and boundaries .

Thesis: The conventional notion of what a concept is, is wrong:
namely, the view that a concept relates in some way to the
qualities of characteristics that all things falling under
the concept have . As, for example, one might claim, in a
sinple-nindGd way that everything that is an arch has such-
and-such properties. Wittgenstein takes the concept of a
G^ne ^nd argues that or.G could not define a game by necessary
and sufficient qualities. For any proposed necessary
characteristic of being a gane . Wittgenstein can think of a
game that does not have the characteristic. Patience (Solitai're)
for example is not competetive and so on. From this' he argues
that entities under a concept form a something more like a

family, just as some members of a family shar characteristic

*

X, some characteristic Y. The moral he draws is that i^^-^
there are not firm boundaries to concepts, nor are there to
linguistic usage, or to the application of linguistic rules.

ii)

1.37

$ 69 . How should we explain to someone what
a game is? I imagine that wg should describe
games to him, and we might add: "This and
similar things are called ^games'". And d^b'>/e
know any more about it ourselves? Is it only
other people whom we cannot tell exactly what
a game is?--But this is not ignorance, We do
not know the boundaries because none have been
drawn . To repeat , we can draw a boundary--
for a special purpose. Does it take that to make
the concept usable? Not at alll (Except for
that special purpose.) No more than it took
the definition: 1 pace == 75 cm. to make the
measure of length 'one pace* usable. And if
you want to say "But still, before that it
v/asn't an exact measure", then I reply: very
well, it was an inexact one. --Though you still
owe me a definition of exactness.

$ 70. "But if the concept 'game* is uncircum-
scribed like that, you don't really know what
you mean by a ' game ' " . When I give the des-
cription: "The ground was quits covered with
plants"~-do you want to say Idon't knov; what
I am talking about until I can give a defini-
tion of a plant?

$71 . One might say that the concept game is a
cor ::ePt with blurred edges .--"But is a blurred
concept a concept at all?"--Is an indistinct
photograph a picture of a person at all? Is it
even always an advantage to replace an in-
distinct picture by a sharp one? Isn't the
indistinct one often exactly what we need?

$76. If someone were to draw a sharp boundary
I could not acknowledge it as the one that I
too always wanted to draw , or had drawn in my
mind. For I did not v/ant to draw one at all.
Hie concept, can then be said to be not the same
as mine, bui ;akin to it. The kinship is that
of two pictures, one of which consists of colour
patches with vague contours., and the other
of patches s imilarly shaped and distributed,
but with clear contours. The kinship is just
as undeniable as the difference.

41

1. 38

$ 84. I said thst the application of a
word is not everywhere bounded by rules.
But what does a game look like that is every-
v;here bounded by rules? whose rules never let
a doubt creep in^ but stop up all the cracks
where it aight?--Can't we imagine a rule
determining the application of a rul^e, and
a doubt which it removes- --and so on?

$80. I say "There is a cha:::r". What if I
go up to it, meaning to fetch it, and it

suddenly disappears from sight? *'So it

wasn't a chair, but some kind of illusion".
But in a few moments we see it again and are

able to touch it and so on. "So the chair was

there after all and its disappearance was

some kind of illusion". But suppose that

after a time it disappears again or seems to

disappear. What are we to say now? Have

you rules ready for such cases rules saying

whether one may use the word ''chair" to in-
clude this kind of thing? But do we miss
them when we use the word "chair"; and are
we to say that we do not really attach any
meaning to this word, because we are not
equiped with rules for every possible appli-
cation of it?

$ 88. If I tell someone "Stand roughly here"--
may not this explanation work perfectly? And
cannot every other one fail too?

But isn't it an inexact explanation? Yes ;

v;hy shouldn ' t we call it "inexact"? Only
let us understand what " inexact "means . For it
does not mean "unusable ". And let us consider
what we call "inexact".

$ 99. The sense of a sentencG--one v/ould like
to saw- -may , of course , leave this or that
open , but the sentence must nevertheless have
a definite sense. An indefinite sense-- that
V70uld really not be a sense at allT-This is like
An indefinite boundary is not really a
boundary at all . Here one things -perhaps: If
I say "I have locked the man up fast in the
room-- there is only one door left open"-- then

1. 39

ERIC

I Simply haven't locked him in at all> his
being locked in is a sham. One would be . in-
clined to say hare: "You haven't done anything
at all". An enclosure with a hole in it is
as good as mono. --But is that true?

$ 100. "But stillf it isn't a game, if there
is some vaguness in the rules". — But does this
prevent its being a game?-- "Perhaps you'll call
it a game, but at any rate it certainly isn't
a perfect game." This means: it has impuri
ties, and what I am interested in at present is
the pure article . ---But I want to say: we misunder-
stand the role of the ideal in our language.
That is to say: we too should call it a game,
only we are dazzled by the ideal and therefore
fail to see the actual use of the word "game"
clearly .

$ 133. It is not our aim to refine or complete
the system of ru^es for the use of our words
in unheard-of ways .

Comment:

There are many connexions between this position and
those encountered in modern hi and linguistics. Let me
suggest just two for discussion.

First, can we have a serious computational semantic
system until we have a self-extending onej one able to
try things out, know that it had gone wrong, or re-draw
built in boundaries. Secondly, can we work in this field
and believe that there is a right set of rules of any
sort, one to be confirmed or disconfirmed in the way a.
scientific hypothesis is?

^^^^ The ling uistic whole and confronting the world
Thesis:- A language is a whole and does not confront the
world sentence by sentence for the testing of its truth
or falsity. The conventions of the language itself

1.40

determine what are the criteria of truth and falsity in

different areas of discourse. whey are different in

mathematics, jokes, history, fortune cookies, advice columns,
science, psychiatric interviev/s etc,

$ 199 . To understand a sentence means to
understand a language. To understand a.
language.

Comment:

This thesis is clearly i^icompatible both with Wittgenstein's
own early "picture theory of truth", and with any theory
like Montague's, where the ass,umption is precisely that each
sentence of a language has its truth ' (and its meaning)
tested individually and in isolation. I shall argue in
some detail that Wittgenstein's view is not at all incon-
sistent with a standard view of scientific truth, where
sentences such as "This particle has spin 1/2" "Rats are
carriers of plague" are not tested directly but belong
only within large systems of inference that must be tested
indirectly if at all.

(v) Logicians have a false picture of hov; language is T

Thesis: logicians think that language is like their

favourite calculus, but thoy Tare quite wrong. Moreover,

it is language itself and its use that is the standard for

testing disputes that arise, not what logicians dictate.

$81 . F . P . Ramsey once emphasized in
conversation with me that logic was a
' normative sci -^r^ce ' . I do not know exactly
what he had in mind, but it was doubtless
closely related to what only dawned on me
later: namely, that in philosophy we often
compare the use of words with games and
calculi which have fixed rules, but cannot
say that someone v7ho is using language must

44

1.41

be playing such a game . But if you say

that our languages only approximate to such
calculi you are standing on the very brink
of a misunderstanding- For then it may
look a.s if what we are talking about is
an ideal language. As if our logic were^
so to speak; a logic for a vacuum • --Whereas
logic does not treat of language-^-or of thought-
in the sense in which a natural science
treats a natural phenomenon, and the most
that can be said is that we construct
ideal languages. But hero the word "ideal"
is liable to mislead^ for it sounds as if
these languages were better, more perfect,
than our everyday language-, and as if it took
the logi c ian to shew people at last what
a proper sentence looked like-

All this, hov/ever, can only appear in the
right light when one has attained greater
clarity about the concepts of understanding,
meaning, and thinking. For it will then
also become clear what can lead us (and did
lead me) to think that if anyone utters a
sentence and means or understands it he
is operating a calculus according to definite
rules -

$ 9 1

Sut nov; it may come to ,look as if there
were something like a final analysis of our
forms of language, and so a single completely
resolved form of every expression- That is,
as if our usual forms of expression were,
essentially, unanalysed; as if there were
something hidden in them that had to be
brought to 1 ight • VJhen thi s is done the
expression is completely clarified and our
problem solved .

It can also be put like this: we eliminate
misunderstandings by making our expressions
more exact; but now it may look as if we were'
moving towards a particular state, a state of
complete exactness; and as if this were the
real goal of our investigation -

45

i

1,42

$101. We want to say that there can't be
any vagueness in logic. The idea now absorbs
us, that the ideal 'must' be found in reality.
Meanwhile v/e do not as yet see how it occurs
there, nor do we understand the nature of
this "must". We think it must be in realityy
for we think we already see it there .

$115. A picture held us captive. And we
could not get outside it, for it lay in our
language and language seemed to repeat it to
us inexorably .

Comment-^

This thesis clearly clashes head' on, not only wi±h Monta-
gue, but also with those logicians subscribing only to predi--
cate calculus syntax who also have strong views on its appli-
cability to language. Notice that a Wi ttgensteinian is not
claiming that the logicians are b^ing inconsistent , as be-
tween their beliefs and the way they talk every day of
their lives, any more than Phlogistian theorists were being
inconsistent when they speculated v/hile their lungs kept
them alive by oxidation processes. Thoy wore simply des-
cribing phenomena they had not examinedv .

(vi) U nderstanding is not a feeling .

Thesis: We have the idea that "understanding something involves,
or is associated with,- a special feeling of being right. But
the tests of our being right are quite different from the
feeling.

59. (a) "Understanding a word": a state.
But a mental state?--Depression, excitement,
pain, are called mental states. Carry out a
grammatical investigation as follows: we say
"He was depressed the whole day".
"He was in great excitement the v;hole day".
"He has been in continuous pain since
yesterday" .

4C

1,43

We also say "Since yesterday I have understood
this word". "Continuously", though? — To be
sure, one can speak of an interruption of
understanding. But in what cases? Compare:
"When did your pains ..get less?" and '*When
did you stop understanding that word?"

$139. When someone says the word "cube" to
me 9 for example , I know v/hat it means • But
can the whole use of the word come before
my mind, when I understand it in this way ?

Well, but on the other hand isn't the mean-
ing of the word r?-l so determined by thi s use?
And can these v/ays of determining meaning
conflict? Can what v/e grasp in a flash
accord with a use, fit or fail to fit it?
And how can what is present to us in an in-
stant, what comes be fore our mind in an
instant, fit a use?

What really comes be fore our mind when v/e
understand a v7ord?--isn ' t it something like
a picture? Can't it be a picture?

Well, suppose that a picture does come
before your mind when you hear the word
"cube", say the drawing of a cube. In
what sense can this picture fit or fail
to fit a use of the word " cube "?- -Perhaps
you say: "It's quite simpler--if that pic-
ture occurs to me and I point to a triangu-
lar prism for instance , and say it is a
cube, then this use jof the word doesn't
fit the picture, "--But doesn ' t it fit? I
have purposely so chosen the example that
it is quite easy to imagine a method of
projection according to which the picture
does fit after all.

The picture of the cube did indeed sug-
gest a certain use to us, but it was possi-
ble for me to use it differently.

$ 151 , But there is also this use of the
word "to know": v/e say "Now I know! "--and
similarly "Now I can do iti" and "Now I
understand ' "

47

1.44

Let us imagine the following example:
A v;rites series of numbers down: B watches
him and tries to find a law for the sequence
of numbers. If he succeeds he exclaims:

"Now I can go onT' So this capacity, this

understanding ^ is something that makes its
appearance in a moment. So let us try and
see vhat it is that makes its appearance
here . has written down the numbers 1 , 5 ,
11, 19, 29jat this point B says he knows
how to go on , What happened here? Various
things may have happened: for e.xample, while
A was slowly putting one number after another,
B was occupied with trying various algebraic
formulae on the numbers which had been
written down. After A had written the
number 19 B tried the formula a^^ = n2 + n - Ij
and the next number confirmed his hypothesis.

, 155 . Thus what I v/anted to say was : when

he suddenly knew hov/ to go on, when he under-
stood the principle, then possibly he had
a special experiencG--and if he is asked:
*'V?hat was it? What took place when you
suddenly grasped the principle?" perhaps
he will describe it much as we described

it above but for us it is the circumstances

under which he had such an experience that
justify him in saying in such a case that
he understands, that he knows how to go on.

Part II, p. 181.

Even if someone had a particular capacity
only when, and only as long as he had a
particular feeling,' the feeling would not
be the capacity ,

The meaning of a word is not the exper-
ience one has in hearing or saying it, and
the sense of a sentence is not a complex of
such experiences.-- (How do the meanings of
the individual words make up the sense of
the sentence '^l still haven't seen him
yef?) The sentence is composed of the
words, and that is enough.

48

1.45

Th«*re are two clear connexions botv/ean this position and
our interests: first, in general AI terms, W. is making the
point that it is dangerous to assess "understanding" in
terms other than actual and possible performance. At this
point I will draw your attention to certain current
disputes discussed in my other course.

Secondly, there seems to me to be a confusion in some
current work in computational semantics between how xve feel
about our own processes, and v/hat an automaton must do .
Consider, sense disambiguation and relate the following
argument of Dreyfus' (q-v. P. 228) to Schank's argument
that a proper analysis system never follows a v/rong path :

Of course, it only looks like "narrowing
down" or "dis-ambiguation" to someone
who approaches the problem from the com-
puter's point of view. We shall see later
that for a hum^n being the situation is
structured in terms of interrelated meanings
so that the other possible meanings of a
word or utterance never even have to be
eliminated. They simply do not arise.

Are these positions not the same as the one Wittgenstein
describes in relation to "the whole use of a word coming
before the mind"? Is there a moral here about taking how
we feel too seriously?

(vii) Application justifies our structures .

Thesis: The significance of a representational structure
cannot be divorced from the process of its application to
actual language.

Bemerkungen P. 308

$43--.'5. We cannot compare a picture with
reality if we cannot lay it against
reality as a measuring rod and'the rod
must be in the same space as the object
to be measured*

40

1*46

Comment

This notion of ''the same space'* is a difficult one, and
refers back to topic (iv) thcit the space cannot be the phy-
sical world if the "rod" is linguistic. The notion can be
taken as a plea for congruence between representational
structures and language: that they exist in the same logi-
cal space and can be shown to do so. At this point I would
remind you of some of my arguments about application from
my other course.

(viii) Real world knowledge eind forms of life.

Thesis: language understanding is not independent of very
general inductive truths about our human experience.

$142. It is only in normal cases that the
use of a word is clearly prescribed; we
know, are in no doubt, what to say in this-
or that case. The more abnormal the case, the
more doubtful it becomes what we are to
say . And if things v/ere quite different

from wha^t they actually are if there were

for instance no characteristic expression
of pain, of fear, of joy, if rule became
^ exception and exception rule? or if both

became phenomena of roughly equal frequency

this would make our normal language-games

lose their point. The procedure of

putting a lump of cheese on a balance and
fixing the price by the turn of the scale
would lose its point if it frequently
happened for such lumps to suddenly grow
or shrink for no obvious reason . This
remark v/ill become clearer when we discuss
such things as the relation of expression
to feeling , and similar topics .

II. xii. If the formation of concepts can bo explaiiitiri
by facts of nature, should we not be interes-
ted, not in grammar, so much as in nature

which forms the basis of grammar? Our

interest certainly includes the way concepts

50

1.47

answer to very general facts of nature.
(Such facts as usually do not strike us be- "
cause of their generality.) But our interest
does not revert to these possible causes
of contept- formation J v/e're not doing
natural sciencGf nor aven natural history -
since we can indeed construct fictitious
natural history for our purposes.

Gomment :

Those who have followed other courses in the tutorial

will be aware of the extent to which AI workers have em-

phasised the importance of partial/inductive knowledge in
our understanding of language. This point has been largely
overlooked by linguists, and all I an doing here is drawing

attention to W

s way of making the point 40 years ago •

Recently, task agnostic pre-training with largescale transformer models has achieved great success in natural language processing (Devlin et al.,
2019), especially open-domain dialogue generation. For instance, based on the general language model GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), DialoGPT
(Zhang et al., 2020) is further trained for response generation using Reddit comments. To obtain a human-like open-domain chatbot, Meena (Adiwardana et al., 2020) scales up the network parameters to 2.6B and employs more social media conversations in the training process, leading to significant improvement on response quality. To mitigate undesirable toxic or bias traits of large corpora,
Blender (Roller et al., 2021) fine-tunes the pretrained model with human annotated datasets and emphasizes desirable conversational skills of engagingness, knowledge, empathy and personality.
In addition to the attempts from model scale and data selection, PLATO (Bao et al., 2020) aims

Introduction

One-to-Many Mapping
Diverse Response Generation

to tackle the inherent one-to-many mapping problem to improve response quality. The one-to-many mapping refers to that one dialogue context might correspond to multiple appropriate responses. It is widely recognized that the capability of modeling one-to-many relationship is crucial for opendomain dialogue generation (Zhao et al., 2017;
Chen et al., 2019). PLATO explicitly models this one-to-many relationship via discrete latent variables, aiming to boost the quality of dialogue generation. PLATO has a modest scale of 132M network parameters and trained with 8M samples, achieving relatively good performance among conversation models on a similar scale. However, scaling up
PLATO directly encounters training instability and efficiency issues, which might result from the difficulty to capture the one-to-many semantic relationship from scratch.
In this work, we try to scale up PLATO to
PLATO-2 and introduce an effective training schema via curriculum learning (Bengio et al.,
2009). There are two stages involved in the whole learning process, as shown in Figure 1. In the first stage, under the simplified one-to-one mapping modeling, a coarse-grained generation model is trained for response generation under different conversation contexts. This model tends to capture typical patterns of diversified responses, sometimes resulting in general and dull responses during inference. Despite the problem of safe responses,

this coarse-grained model is still highly effective in learning general concepts of response generation.
The curriculum learning continues to the second stage, which contains the training of a fine-grained generation model and an evaluation model. The fine-grained generation model explicitly models the one-to-many mapping relationship via latent variables for diverse response generation. To select the most appropriate response, an evaluation model is trained to estimate the bi-directional coherence between the dialogue context and responses. Distinct with multi-task PLATO, the separate design of fine-grained generation and evaluation enables the model to concentrate more on its corresponding task, getting exempt from multi-task disturbance
(Standley et al., 2020).
As compared with PLATO, PLATO-2 leverages curriculum learning to learn response generation gradually, from the general concept of one-to-one mapping to the complex concept of one-to-many mapping. With curriculum learning, we successfully scale the model up to billions of parameters, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Besides open-domain chitchat, the models learned in these two stages can also benefit task-oriented conversation and knowledge grounded dialogue respectively, whose effectiveness is verified thoroughly in DSTC9 (Gunasekara et al., 2020).
To sum up, we trained PLATO-2 with different model sizes: 1.6B, 314M and 93M parameters. In addition to the English models, we also trained Chinese models with massive social media conversations. Comprehensive experiments on both English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that PLATO-2
outperforms Meena, Blender and other state-of-theart models. We have released our English models and source codes at GitHub, hoping to facilitate the research in open-domain dialogue generation.1

Methodology

The backbone of PLATO-2 is consisted of transformer blocks with pre-normalization (Radford et al., 2019). Distinct with conventional Seq2Seq, there are no separate encoder and decoder networks in our infrastructure. PLATO-2 keeps the unified network for bi-directional context encoding and uni-directional response generation through flexible attention mechanism (Dong et al., 2019).
2.1

Curriculum Learning

In this work, we carry out effective training of
PLATO-2 via curriculum learning. As shown in
Figure 2, there are two stages involved in the learning process: during stage 1, a coarse-grained baseline model is trained for general response generation under the simplified one-to-one mapping relationship; during stage 2, two models of fine-grained generation and evaluation are further trained for diverse response generation and response coherence estimation respectively.

2.1.1 General Response Generation
It is well known that there exists a one-to-many relationship in open-domain conversations, where a piece of context may have multiple appropriate responses. Since conventional approaches try to fit the one-to-one mapping, they tend to generate generic and dull responses. Whereas, it is still an efficient way to capture the general characteristics of response generation. As such, we first train a coarse-grained baseline model to learn general response generation under the simplified relationship of one-to-one mapping. Given one training sample of context and response (c, r), we need to minimize the following negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss:
LBaseline
N LL = −E log p(r|c)
XT
= −E
log p(rt |c, r<t ) ,

where T is the length of the target response r and r<t denotes previously generated words. Since the response generation is a uni-directional decoding process, each token in the response only attends to those before it, shown as dashed orange lines in Figure 2. As for the context, bi-directional attention is enabled for better natural language understanding, shown as blue lines in Figure 2.
2.1.2 Diverse Response Generation
Based upon the coarse-grained baseline model, diverse response generation is warm started and further trained under the relationship of one-to-many mapping. Following the previous work PLATO, the discrete latent variable z is introduced for the oneto-many relationship modeling. z is one K-way categorical variable, with each value corresponding to a particular latent speech act in the response.
The model will first estimate the latent act distribution of the training sample p(z|c, r) and then generate the response with the sampled latent variable p(r|c, z). It is notable that these two tasks of response generation and latent act recognition are trained jointly within the shared network. The NLL
loss of diverse response generation is defined as:
LGeneration
= −Ez∼p(z|c,r) log p(r|c, z)
N LL
= −Ez∼p(z|c,r)

p(z|c, r) = softmax(W1 h[M ] + b1 ) ∈ RK , (3)
where h[M ] ∈ RD is the final hidden state of the special mask token [M], W1 ∈ RK×D and b1 ∈ RK denote the weight matrices of one fullyconnected layer.
To facilitate the training process of discrete latent variables, the bag-of-words (BOW) loss (Zhao et al., 2017) is also employed:
LGeneration
= −Ez∼p(z|c,r)

posterior distribution over latent values is estimated through the task of latent act recognition:

where V refers to the whole vocabulary. The function f tries to predict the words within the target response in a non-autoregressive way: f = W2 hz + b2 ∈ R|V | ,

(5)

where hz is the final hidden state of the latent variable. frt denotes the estimated probability of word rt . As compared with NLL loss, the BOW loss discards word orders and forces the latent variable to capture the global information of target response.
To sum up, the objective of the fine-grained generation model is to minimize the following integrated loss:
LGeneration = LGeneration
+ LGeneration

Response Coherence Estimation

By assigning distinct values to the latent variable, the fine-grained generation model is able to produce multiple high-quality and diverse responses.
To select the most appropriate response from these candidates, one straightforward way is to rank them according to p(z|c)p(r|c, z). However, it is widely recognized that the prior distribution p(z|c) is difficult to estimate and the uniform distribution is not an effective approximation. To this end, we adopt an alternative approach to train an evaluation model in the second stage, estimating the coherence between each response and the given dialogue context. The loss of response coherence estimation
(RCE) is defined as follows:

where z is the latent act sampled from p(z|c, r).
As sampling is not differentiable, we approximate it with Gumbel-Softmax (Jang et al., 2017). The
2515

LEvaluation
= − log p(lr = 1|c, r)
RCE
− log p(lr− = 0|c, r− )

(7)

The positive training samples come from the dialogue context and corresponding target response
(c, r), with coherence label lr = 1. And the negative samples are created by randomly selecting responses from the corpus (c, r− ), with coherence label lr− = 0.
In addition to our coherence evaluation function p(lr |c, r), there are two other functions widely used for response selection. One is the length-average log-likelihood (Adiwardana et al., 2020), which considers the forward response generation probability p(r|c). The other one is the maximum mutual information (Zhang et al., 2020), which considers the backward context recovery probability p(c|r).
However, the forward score favors safe and generic responses due to the property of maximum likelihood, while the backward score tends to select the response with a high overlap with the context, resulting in repetitive conversations. By contrast, the discriminative function p(lr |c, r) considers the bidirectional information flow between the dialogue context and response. Our coherence evaluation is able to ameliorate the aforementioned problems, whose effectiveness is verified in the experiments.
To maintain the capacity of distributed representation, the task of masked language model (MLM)
(Devlin et al., 2019) is also included in the evaluation network. Within this task, 15% of the input tokens will be masked at random and the network needs to recover the masked ones. The MLM loss is defined as:
X
LEvaluation
= −E
log p(xm |x\M ), (8)
M LM
m∈M

where x refers to the input tokens of context and response. {xm }m∈M stands for masked tokens and x\M denotes the rest unmasked ones.
To sum up, the objective of the evaluation model is to minimize the following integrated loss:
LEvaluation = LEvaluation
+ LEvaluation
RCE
M LM
2.2

(9)

Inference

For open-domain chitchat, the inference is carried out with the second stage’s models as follows.
1) Diverse response generation. Conditioned on each latent value z ∈ {1, · · · , K}, its corresponding candidate response rz is produced by the fine-grained generation model p(rz |c, z).
2) Response coherence estimation. The evaluation model will preform ranking and select the one with highest coherence value as the final response r∗ = argmaxrz p(lrz = 1|c, rz ).

Experiments

3.1

Training Data

PLATO-2 has English and Chinese models, with training data extracted from open-domain social media conversations. The English training data is extracted from Reddit comments, which are collected by a third party and made publicly available on pushshift.io (Baumgartner et al., 2020). To improve the generation quality, we carry out elaborate data cleaning, as discussed in the Appendix. After filtering, the data is split into training and validation sets in chronological order. The training set contains 684M (context, response) samples, ranging from December 2005 to July 2019. For the validation set, 0.2M samples are selected from the rest data after July 2019. The English vocabulary contains 8K BPE tokens (Sennrich et al., 2016), constructed with the SentencePiece library.
The Chinese training data is collected from public domain social medias. After filtering, there are
1.2B (context, response) samples in the training set,
0.1M samples in the validation set, and 0.1M samples in the test set. As for the Chinese vocabulary, it contains 30K BPE tokens.
3.2

Training Details

PLATO-2 has three model sizes: a standard version of 1.6B parameters, a small version of 314M
parameters, and a tiny version of 93M parameters.
Detailed network and training configurations are summarized in the Appendix. The main hyperparameters used in the training process are listed as follows. The maximum sequence lengths of context and response are all set to 128. K is set to 20
for the discrete latent variable (Bao et al., 2020;
Chen et al., 2019). We use Adam (Kingma and
Ba, 2015) as the optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler including a linear warmup and an invsqrt decay (Vaswani et al., 2017). To train the largescale model with a relatively large batch size, we employ gradient checkpointing (Chen et al., 2016)
to trade computation for memory. The training was carried out on 64 Nvidia Tesla V100 32G GPU
cards. It takes about 3 weeks for 1.6B parameter model to accomplish curriculum learning process.

Evaluation Settings
Compared Methods

The following methods have been compared in the experiments.

2516

• PLATO (Bao et al., 2020) is trained on the basis of BERTBASE using 8.3M Twitter and Reddit conversations (Cho et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2018;
Galley et al., 2019). There are 132M network parameters in this model.
• DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020) is trained on the basis of GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) using
Reddit comments. There are three model sizes:
117M, 345M and 762M. Since the 345M parameter model obtains the best performance in their evaluations, we compare with this version.
• Blender (Roller et al., 2021) is first trained using Reddit comments and then fine-tuned with human annotated conversations – BST (Smith et al., 2020), to help emphasize desirable conversational skills of engagingness, knowledge, empathy and personality. Blender has three model sizes: 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B. Since the 2.7B parameter model obtains the best performance in their evaluations, we compare with this version.
• Meena (Adiwardana et al., 2020) is an opendomain chatbot trained with social media conversations. There are 2.6B network parameters in
Meena. Since Meena has not released the model or provided a service interface, it is difficult to perform comprehensive comparison. In the experiments, we include the provided samples in their paper for static evaluation.
• Microsoft XiaoIce (Zhou et al., 2020) is a popular social chatbot in Chinese. The official Weibo platform is used in the evaluation.
For the sake of comprehensive and fair comparisons, different versions of PLATO-2 are included in the experiments.
• PLATO-2 1.6B parameter model is the standard version in English, which is first trained using
Reddit comments and then fine-tuned with BST
conversations. To measure the effectiveness of
PLATO-2, this model will be compared to the state-of-the-art open-domain chatbot Blender.
• PLATO-2 314M parameter model is a small version in English, which is trained with Reddit comments. This model will be compared to DialoGPT, as they have similar model scales.
• PLATO-2 93M parameter model is a tiny version in English, which is trained with Reddit comments. As it is difficult to scale up PLATO, we use this version to compare with PLATO.
• PLATO-2 336M parameter Chinese model2 will be compared to XiaoIce in the experiments.

This model has 24 transformer blocks and 16 attention

3.3.2

Evaluation Metrics

We carry out both automatic and human evaluations in the experiments. In automatic evaluation, to assess the model’s capacity on lexical diversity, we use the corpus-level metric of distinct-1/2 (Li et al.,
2016a), which is defined as the number of distinct uni- or bi-grams divided by the total number of generated words.
In human evaluation, we employ four utterancelevel and dialogue-level metrics, including coherence, informativeness, engagingness and humanness. Three crowd-sourcing workers are asked to score the response/dialogue quality on a scale of
[0, 1, 2], with the final score determined through majority voting. The higher score, the better. These criteria are discussed as follows, with scoring details provided in the Appendix.
• Coherence is an utterance-level metric, measuring whether the response is relevant and consistent with the context.
• Informativeness is also an utterance-level metric, evaluating whether the response is informative or not given the context.
• Engagingness is a dialogue-level metric, assessing whether the annotator would like to talk with the speaker for a long conversation.
• Humanness is also a dialogue-level metric, judging whether the speaker is a human being or not.
3.4

Experimental Results

In the experiments, we include both static and interactive evaluations.
3.4.1

Self-Chat Evaluation

Self-chats have been widely used in the evaluation of dialogue systems (Li et al., 2016b; Bao et al.,
2019; Roller et al., 2021), where a model plays the role of both partners in the conversation. As compared with human-bot conversations, self-chat logs can be collected efficiently at a cheaper price.
As reported in Li et al. (2019), self-chat evaluations exhibit high agreement with the human-bot chat evaluations. In the experiments, we ask the bot to perform self-chats and then invite crowd-sourcing workers to evaluate the dialogue quality.
The way to start the interactive conversation needs special attention. As pointed out by Roller et al. (2021), if starting with ‘Hi!’, partners tend heads, with the embedding dimension of 1024. As the Chinese vocabulary contains 30K BPE tokens, this model has 22.5M
more parameters than the English small model.

to greet with each other and only cover some shallow topics in the short conversation. Therefore, to expose the model’s weaknesses and explore the model’s limits, we choose to start the interactive conversation with pre-selected topics. We use the classical 200 questions as the start topic (Vinyals and Le, 2015) and ask the bot to performance selfchats given the context. There are 10 utterances in each dialogue, including the input start utterance.
We carry out automatic evaluation on the 200 selfchat logs and randomly select 50 conversations for human evaluation.
The compared models are divided into three groups. The first group includes PLATO 132M
model and PLATO-2 93M model. Both of them have similar model scales. The second group includes DialoGPT 345M model and PLATO-2
310M model. Both of them are trained using Reddit comments and have similar model scales. The third group includes Blender 2.7B model and PLATO-2
1.6B model. Both of them are first trained using
Reddit comments and further fine-tuned with BST
conversations. In human evaluation, two self-chat logs, which are from the same group and have the same start topic, will be displayed to three annotators. One example is given in Figure 3. As suggested in ACUTE-Eval (Li et al., 2019), we ask crowd-sourcing workers to pay attention to only one speaker within a dialogue. In the evaluation, they need to give scores on coherence and informativeness for each P1’s utterance, and assess P1’s overall quality on engagingness and humanness.

The self-chat evaluation results are summarized in Table 1. These results indicate that PLATO-2
1.6B model obtains the best performance across human and automatic evaluations. In the first group, PLATO-2 achieves better performance than
PLATO on a similar model scale, which might mainly result from the stable curriculum learning and large-scale conversation data. In the second group, DialoGPT tends to generate repetitive conversations due to the backward scoring function, resulting in poor performance in interactive evaluation. In the third group, PLATO-2 outperforms the state-of-the-art open-domain chatbot Blender. The gap of Blender and PLATO-2 on the corpus-level metric distinct-1/2 suggests that PLATO-2 has a better capacity on lexical diversity. In addition, the difference among these three groups suggests that enlarging model scales and exploiting human annotated conversations help improve the dialogue quality.
3.4.2

Human-Bot Chat Evaluation

In the Chinese evaluation, it is difficult to carry out self-chats for Microsoft XiaoIce, as there is no public available API. Therefore, we collect human-bot conversations through their official Weibo platform.
The interactive conversation also starts with a preselected topic and continues for 7-14 rounds. 50 diverse topics are extracted from the high-frequency topics of a commercial chatbot, including travel, movie, hobby and so on. The collected humanbot conversations are distributed to crowd-sourcing

workers for evaluation. The human and automatic evaluation results are summarized in Table 2. XiaoIce obtains higher distinct values, which may use a retrieval-based strategy in response generation.
The human evaluations indicate that our PLATO2 model achieves significant improvements over
XiaoIce across all the human evaluation metrics.

Model

Static Evaluation

Besides the interactive evaluation, we also employ static evaluation to analyze the model’s performance. In static evaluation, each model will produce a response towards the given multi-turn context. Those powerful models are involved in the evaluation: Meena, Blender, DialoGPT and
PLATO-2 1.6B. To compare with Meena, we include their provided 60 static samples in the Appendix of the paper and generate corresponding responses with other models. We also include 60
test samples about daily life from Daily Dialog (Li et al., 2017) and 60 test samples about in-depth discussion from Reddit. Given that the measurement of humanness usually needs multi-turn interaction, this metric is excluded from static evaluation. The evaluation results are summarized in Table 3. It can be observed that PLATO-2 is able to produce coherent, informative and engaging responses across different chat scenarios. The average Fleiss’s kappa
(Fleiss, 1971) of human evaluation is 0.466, indicating annotators have reached moderate agreement.

Discussions
Case Analysis

To further analyze the models’ features, two selfchat examples of Blender and PLATO-2 are provided in Figure 3. Although both models are able to produce high-quality engaging conversations, they exhibit distinct discourse styles. Blender tends to switch topics quickly in the short conversation, including alcohol, hobbies, movies and work. The emergence of this style might be related with BST

fine-tuning data. For instance, persona chat in BST
is about the exchange of personal information between two partners, where topics need to switch quickly to know more about each other. Due to the task settings of data collection, some human annotated conversations might be a little unnatural.
Nevertheless, fine-tuning with BST conversations is essential to mitigate undesirable toxic traits of large corpora and emphasize desirable skills of human conversations.
Distinct with Blender, PLATO-2 can stick to the start topic and conduct in-depth discussions. The reasons might be two-fold. First, our model is able to generate diverse and informative responses with the accurate modeling of one-to-many relationship.
Second, the evaluation model helps select the coherent response and stick to current topic. We asked crowd-sourcing workers to annotate which model’s in-depth discussion is better w.r.t. the start topic.
The comparison result is shown in Table 4, which also verifies our above analysis on discourse styles.
3.5.2 Why PLATO-2 Performs Better?
Why PLATO-2 achieves better performance as compared with Meena, Blender and other state-ofthe-art models? As analyzed above, major reasons might come from two aspects: fine-grained generation and evaluation. First, PLATO-2 employs discrete latent variable for the one-to-many relationship modeling, which is able to generate highquality and diverse responses. Second, the evaluation model in PLATO-2 is effective at selecting the most appropriate response from the candidates.
In fact, these two aspects are associated with the curriculum learning in the second stage, modeling the one-to-many relationship for open-domain conversations. By contrast, Meena and Blender are learned under the one-to-one mapping relationship, similar to the first stage in PLATO-2. To dissect the effects of these two stage models, we further

3.5.3 Further Exploration of PLATO-2
In addition to open-domain chitchat, there are two other kinds of dialogues in conversational AI
(Gao et al., 2018): knowledge grounded dialogue, and task-oriented conversation. Similar to opendomain conversation, the one-to-many mapping relationship also exists in knowledge grounded dialogue (Kim et al., 2020): given a dialogue context, multiple pieces of knowledge might be applicable for the response generation. Therefore, the one-to-many mapping models of the second stage can also be adapted for knowledge grounded dialogue. By expanding the network input with the knowledge segment, the background knowledge is encoded and grounded for response generation.
Distinct from the open-domain conversation and knowledge grounded dialogue, task-oriented conversations usually need to accomplish a specific goal. Accordingly, the conversation flow would become less diverse and concentrated on task completion. Therefore, the one-to-one mapping generation model of the first stage can be used for the end-to-end task-oriented conversation.
For the exploration of PLATO-2 two-stage framework, we participated in several tasks of
DSTC9 (Gunasekara et al., 2020), including interactive evaluation of open-domain conversation
(Track3-task2), static evaluation of knowledge grounded dialogue (Track3-task1), and end-to-end task-oriented conversation (Track2-task1). PLATO2 has achieved the first place in all three tasks (Bao et al., 2021). To sum up, the benefits brought by the two-stage curriculum learning in PLATO-2 are two-fold. Firstly, given the difficulties to scale up PLATO, the two-stage curriculum learning is an essential ingredient for the successful training of 1.6B parameter PLATO-2. Secondly, the twostage PLATO-2 adapts well to multiple conversational tasks, indicating its potentials as a unified pre-training framework for conversational AI.

Related Work

Related works include large-scale language models and open-domain dialogue generation.
Large-scale Language Models. Pre-trained largescale language models have brought many break-

2520

throughs on various NLP tasks. GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) are representative uni-directional and bi-directional language models, trained on general text corpora.
By introducing pre-normalization and modifying weight initialization, GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
successfully extends the model scale from 117M
to 1.5B parameters. To cope with memory constraints, Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019) exploits model parallelism to train an 8.3B parameter model on 512 GPUs. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)
further trains an 175B parameter autoregressive language model, demonstrating strong performance on many NLP tasks. The development of largescale language models is also beneficial to the task of dialogue generation.
Open-domain Dialogue Generation. On the basis of GPT-2, DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2020) is trained for response generation using Reddit comments. To obtain a human-like open-domain chatbot, Meena (Adiwardana et al., 2020) scales up the network parameters to 2.6B and utilizes more social media conversations in the training process.
To emphasize desirable conversational skills of engagingness, knowledge, empathy and personality, Blender (Roller et al., 2021) further fine-tunes the pre-trained model with human annotated conversations. In addition to the attempts on model scale and data selection, PLATO introduces discrete latent variable to tackle the inherent one-tomany mapping problem to improve response quality. In this work, we explore the effective training of PLATO-2 via curriculum learning.

In this work, we discuss the effective training of open-domain chatbot PLATO-2 via curriculum learning, where two stages are involved. In the first stage, one coarse-grained model is trained for general response generation. In the second stage, two models of fine-grained generation and evaluation are trained for diverse response generation and response coherence estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that PLATO-2 achieves substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in both Chinese and English evaluations.

PLATO-2 has three model sizes: a standard version of 1.6B parameters, a small version of 314M parameters, and a tiny version of 93M parameters. The
1.6B parameter model has 32 transformer blocks and 32 attention heads, with the embedding dimension of 2048. The 314M parameter model has 24
transformer blocks and 16 attention heads, with the embedding dimension of 1024. The 93M parameter model has 12 transformer blocks and 12
attention heads, with the embedding dimension of
768. The training configurations of PLATO-2 1.6B
are provided in Table 6. The training was carried out on 64 Nvidia Tesla V100 32G GPU cards. It takes about 3 weeks for the 1.6B parameter model to accomplish the curriculum learning process.

C

Data Cleaning Process

PLATO-2 has English and Chinese models, with training data extracted from open-domain social media conversations. As the comments are formatted in message trees, any conversation path from the root to a tree node can be treated as one training sample, with the node as response and its former turns as context. To improve the generation quality, we carry out elaborate data cleaning. A message node and its sub-trees will be removed if any of the following conditions is met.
1) The number of BPE tokens is more than 128
or less than 2.

Training Configurations

Chinese Case Analysis

We also provide two human-bot chat examples of
XiaoIce and PLATO-2 in Figure 4, with original interactive logs shown on the left and translated logs on the right. It can be observed that some responses produced by XiaoIce are not coherent with the contexts and there are some abrupt changes of topics. By contrast, the interaction with PLATO2 is more coherent and engaging.

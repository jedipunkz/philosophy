ABSTRACT

Motivation: Methods for detecting somatic genome rearrangements
in tumours using next-generation sequencing are vital in cancer gen-
omics. Available algorithms use one or more sources of evidence,
such as read depth, paired-end reads or split reads to predict struc-
tural variants. However, the problem remains challenging due to the
significant computational burden and high false-positive or false-
negative rates.

Results: In this article, we present Socrates (SOft Clip re-alignment To
idEntify Structural variants), a highly efficient and effective method for
detecting genomic rearrangements in tumours that uses only split-
read data. Socrates has single-nucleotide resolution, identifies
micro-homologies and untemplated sequence at break points, has
high sensitivity and high specificity and takes advantage of parallelism
for efficient use of resources. We demonstrate using simulated and
real data that Socrates performs well compared with a number of
existing structural variant detection tools.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identification of somatic rearrangements in tumour genomes
using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is an important
step in characterizing cancers, including identifying genomic in-
stability (Campbell et aL, 2010), understanding tumour evolution

(Greenman et aL, 2012) and identifying potential fusion genes
(Campbell et aL, 2008). However, prediction of genomic re-
arrangements remains a challenging bioinformatics problem.
Existing methods suffer from a variety of issues, including high
false-positive (see Wang et aL, 2011, for further discussion) or
false-negative rates depending on the methods, data and nature
of the genomic rearrangements.

To identify genomic rearrangements or structural variants
(SVs), DNA from samples is extracted, fragmented, size selected
and typically paired end (PE) sequenced. There are four distinct
approaches to identifying genomic rearrangements using these
data: read depth, paired end, split reads and de novo assembly
methods. Read depth methods (RD) identify one class of struc-
tural variation — copy number variants. They provide only indir-
ect evidence for break points and no information about genomic
organization. RD methods involve counting reads in windows
and segmenting the counts (see e.g. Miller et aL,20\\). They may
use single-end (SE) or paired-end reads. Their resolution and
accuracy is dependent on the depth of coverage and the
window size, but is typically of the order of kilobases.
Examples of RD methods include readDepth (Miller et aL,
2011) and CNVnator (Abyzov et aL, 2011). Anomalous paired-
end alignment methods (PE) use reads that contain a break point
in the unsequenced region between the paired reads. These reads
map anomalously or discordantly to the reference genome — fur-
ther apart or closer together than expected based on the selected
fragment size, to different chromosomes or with inverted orien-
tation (see e.g. Medvedev et aL, 2009). The signal of a rearrange-
ment is a cluster of anomalous reads. The resolution of PE
methods is related to the fragment size and coverage. In general,
single-nucleotide resolution is not possible with PE methods.
BreakDancer (Chen et aL, 2009) is an example of a PE
method. Split read methods (SR) rely on reads that span the
break point (Fig. 1). Split reads may be identified from single-
end or paired-end sequencing, although using paired-end data
has the advantage of higher quahty alignment. Most NGS

aligners will not map split reads. With PE data, global NGS
aligners will map the unsplit read, while local aligners may also
map part of the split read. With paired-end reads, local NGS
aligners are often greedy to ahgn reads concordantly. Thus, the
aligned part of a split read may be quite short [e.g. 20 nucleotides
(nt)]. A straightforward approach to identifying a split read using
an NGS ahgner is via soft clipping. A soft clip is a special mis-
match state in the alignment that is restricted to contiguous seg-
ments of the read at the 5' or 3' end (Li and Durbin, 2009).
Sequencing errors, chimeric reads, errors in the reference genome
or genomic rearrangement may cause soft clips. SR methods are
capable of single-nucleotide resolution, although micro-homolo-
gies at fusion sites mean the break point may only be known to
1-10 nt accuracy and large imperfect homologies at the break
point may cause lower accuracy again. Examples of SR methods
include Splitread (Karakoc et aL, 2011). Until recently, most
methods used just one of these types of evidence. However, sev-
eral methods have now appeared that make use of more of the
available evidence to predict an SV. For example, DELLY
(Rausch et aL, 2012) and PRISM (Jiang et aL, 2012) use PE
evidence and incorporate SR evidence through a targeted
Smith-Waterman alignment. CNVer (Medvedev et aL, 2010)
uses PE and RD signals to identify potential copy number
changes. De novo assembly methods (DN) typically perform tar-
geted sequence assembly following other evidence to locate the
locus and reads for assembly. For example, CREST (Wang et aL,
2011) uses SR then DN. However, unbiased assembly of the
whole-genome data is also possible. Making better use of the
available evidence to predict break points is obviously desirable,
but how this is undertaken is critical.

To find somatic rearrangements, evidence from a tumour and
a matched normal is used. Typically, SVs are called in both sam-
ples. Variants that occur in the both genomes are most likely
polymorphisms or artefacts. Somatic rearrangements are ob-
tained by subtracting predicted normal SVs from the predicted
tumour SVs. Most methods are not specifically designed for
tumour genomes, and some methods that are designed for germ-
line DNA neglect certain classes of rearrangement, which are
unlikely to be present as polymorphisms (e.g. Suzuki et aL,
2011), making them inappropriate for use in tumours.

The reads produced by NGS platforms are increasing dramat-
ically in length. As a result, the capacity to create DNA libraries
with fragments large enough to retain an unsequenced insert is
decreasing and with it the utility of PE information. Increased

length also means read mappability and the utility of SR meth-
ods is improved. Here, we describe a new method for identifying
somatic rearrangements, Socrates (SOft Clip re-alignment To
idEntify Structural variants), which currently relies only on SR
evidence. Socrates works by efficiently identifying clusters of soft
clipped alignments in the reference genome as candidate break
points. The soft clipped sequences are then extracted and re-
aligned to the reference genome. A genomic rearrangement is
predicted and break points are identified with single-nucleotide
precision when soft clipped sequences from one cluster map to
another with high stringency and there is reciprocal support
(Fig. 1). We have developed Socrates with Bowtie2 (Langmead
and Salzberg, 2012) and BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) in mind,
but it should work with any NGS aligner that supports 5' or 3'
soft clipping. Soft clips that are too short to align are also
counted, but are handled by direct search of the cluster pair.

The idea of re-aligning soft clips has previously been used in
ClipCrop (Suzuki et aL, 2011), but ClipCrop's design is inappro-
priate for identifying genomic rearrangements in tumours, and
our approach incorporates several novel features. Socrates is de-
signed to be fast and memory efficient. It has single-nucleotide
resolution and is designed to be highly sensitive. It also has high
specificity on simulated data. It identifies micro-homologies and
untemplated sequence at break points and deals with promiscu-
ous or re-used break points. Our method was originally moti-
vated by work on the E/x-myc transgenic mouse tumour genome
and the failure of existing methods to detect known fusions using
PE reads from short DNA fragments, but we have tested it ex-
tensively on simulated data and human tumours. Despite its
design for somatic tissue analysis, Socrates can also be used to
analyze SVs in germline DNA. We compare the algorithm's cap-
abilities with other established break point-detection tools using
simulated and real data.

2 METHODS

Socrates is intended for PE read data with reads of at least 100 nt, but will
also run on SE data. It takes aligned short read data in BAM format as
input. The alignment can be performed using any aligner that supports
soft clipping at the 5' or 3' end of reads. Currently, we find Bowtie2 to be
the best choice. The aligned reads are then passed through a series of
processing stages (summarized in Supplementary Fig. SI):

(1) Preprocessing: In this stage, the input BAM file is parsed and a
variety of quality filters are applied, including removal of multi-

1065

J.Schroder et al.

mapping reads and low-quality alignments. This stage is highly
configurable via command line arguments. For further details,
refer to the Supplementary Material and the software documenta-
tion. Preprocessing produces a FASTQ file of long soft clip se-
quences and a BAM file of reads with short soft clips. The
threshold between long and short soft clips is a user-defined par-
ameter (25 nt by default).

(2) Re-alignment: In this stage, the algorithm uses on a short read
aligner to re-map the long soft clipped parts of reads. In the
output BAM file, Socrates maintains the associations between
the new alignment region of the long soft clipped sequence,
which we refer to as the re-aligned locus, and the original alignment
region, which we term the anchor.

(3) Split read clustering: This works on the re-aligned soft clip file and
produces a data structure of split-read clusters that share the same
anchor and re-aligned regions. A cluster may contain one or more
reads. Clustering is the most computationally expensive stage. See
Section 2.1 for details.

(4) Cluster pairing: Clusters are parsed, and cluster pairs are formed
when two clusters provide reciprocal support for a potential re-
arrangement. This step produces part of the algorithm's final
output. See Section 2.2 for details.

(5) Matching short soft clips: Short soft clip sequences are used to try
to find reciprocal support for the remaining unpaired clusters by
directly searching the cluster anchor region using short soft clip
sequences derived from the re-aligned locus. This stage adds extra
cluster pairs to the output, further improving sensitivity. Further
details follow in Section 2.3.

2.1 Split read clustering

The clustering stage groups split reads that support a putative genomic
rearrangement involving a pair of break points from one side of the fusion.
It identifies a cluster of anchored reads on one side and associated re-
aligned soft clips on the other side of the fusion. Socrates parses the
BAM file of the re-aligned long soft clips, creating new clusters and, if
necessary, merges them with already existing clusters that support the
same break point. Clusters are merged if (i) their anchor loci overlap
and include the same break point, and (ii) their re-aligned loci overlap
and include the same break point. However, a small degree of 'wobble'
in the soft clip start locations is observed in a low proportion of reads
(beginning too soon or too late with respect to the actual break point or the
consensus of soft clip starts). This appears to be associated with sequencing
errors and bases with low-quality scores. To account for this, we allow
merging of two clusters even if their soft clip positions are slightly different
(up to 5 nt apart by default). To perform clustering a data structure con-
taining the anchor locus (including a specific break point — the last aligned
position before the soft clipping starts), the re-aligned locus (including a
break point) and a voting matrix for the re-aligned and anchor locus
consensus sequence is used. The voting matrix is used to call the consensus
sequence on either side of the break point. The clusters are kept in a sorted
data structure to keep the search operation efficient.

2.2 Cluster pairing

Reciprocal support of break point events is at the core of the Socrates
algorithm and is key to reducing false-discovery rates. A potential fusion
will be predicted only if reads from both sides of the break points show
soft clip evidence to support the event. This technique reduces false-
positive SVs resulting from singular stochastic events such as chimeras.
The cluster pairing stage of the algorithm identifies such reciprocal sup-
port. If we consider two clusters Ci and C2, which consist of anchor and
re-aligned regions, there are three cases to deal with:

Blunt end joining: Blunt end joining of two loci is the most straight-
forward case to identify (Fig. lA). Two clusters are paired if the re-a-
ligned region of Cj ends at the C2 anchor region start. In other words, the
re-aligned Ci soft cHps map to the C2 anchor region, immediately adja-
cent to the C2 soft-clip site. Additionally, C2 re-aligned region must co-
incide with the Ci anchor region with single nucleotide stringency.

Micro- homology: Micro-homo logics are short (1-10 nt) identical se-
quences, which may be found at either side of break points. If the true
break point is in a region of micro-homology, its exact location cannot be
determined. Furthermore, the reciprocal support for the break point does
not identify exactly the same location. Thus, in the presence of a micro-
homology, the resolution is no longer single nucleotide. The reads that
contribute to Ci clip exactly at the end of the micro-homology (Fig. IB).
In C2, the reads again clip after the region of micro-homology (at its start
on the negative strand). As a result, the procedure for blunt end joining
described above will not suffice to pair the two clusters. The break points
identified by each cluster are Ai and A2 bases apart. In this case, Socrates
tests whether (i) the difference in break points is consistent (Ai = A2) and
(ii) the homologous sequence (the stretch between the anchor break
points and re-aligned loci) is identical in both clusters (here we use the
consensus sequence for comparison). If both conditions are fulfilled, the
micro-homology is identified, and the two clusters are paired up.

Untemplated sequence: A third possible scenario is the presence of
untemplated sequence between the two break points fusion (Fig. IC).
These are short sequences that are part of the normal genome that are
generated during DNA repair. In this case, the extracted soft clip contains
untemplated sequence and when re-ahgned to the reference, the re-aligned
soft clip sequences will themselves be soft-clipped (by 0 nt). There is an
upper limit to the size of the untemplated sequence that Socrates can deal
with, which depends on the read length. Socrates keeps track of this
inserted sequence and includes it in the output. The insertion of untem-
plated sequence at a break point can also coincide with micro-homologies
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In this case, the break point detection again has
single-nucleotide resolution.

Finally, we point out that this scenario also applies if there are two
break points in proximity to each other (fusion A to Bi and fusion B2 to C
with Bi and B2 in proximity, say). In this case, the re-aligned soft cHps will
be placed on locus A and C omitting B as soft clips of the re-aligned
locus. As a result, Socrates will detect a break point ^ to C with novel
insertion sequence equal to B1-B2.

After successfully pairing two clusters, Socrates will parse the short
soft clip input file and search directly for additional read support. This
step accumulates more evidence supporting the break point and may be
useful for genotyping. Every soft clip in the data that clips at the anchor
loci and then matches the re-aligned consensus sequences is noted as a
supporting read for the break point event.

2.3 Short soft clip cluster pairing

In the final stage of the algorithm, Socrates handles all clusters that have
not been matched up as pairs in the previous stage. Socrates attempts to
find supporting evidence for existing clusters by means of reciprocal short
soft clip support (similar to the gathering of short soft clip support in the
previous stage). This is necessary if a particular break point has long (and
therefore remapped) soft clips on one side only. This may occur if there is
low coverage on one side of a break point due to low mappability or high
or low GC content.

In the short soft clip cluster pairing stage, the short soft clips from the
re-aligned locus of unpaired clusters are extracted from the BAM file.
More specifically, reads that overlap the re-aligned break point of the
cluster are extracted. The algorithm then follows the same principles as
the regular cluster pairing with the following difference. Because short
soft clips are not remapped to the reference genome (due to the high
probability of multi-mapping), they have to be compared by direct
search with the cluster's anchor locus. This is efficiently done because

1066

Socrates

Socrates keeps track of the anchor locus consensus sequences. All short
soft clips that match the cluster's anchor sequence with at least 90%
identity are considered as reciprocal support to the cluster. If sufficient
support can be gathered this way, Socrates considers the cluster as a valid
break point and includes it in the output. The level of support is included
in the output for use in filtering. The same details that arise in the event of
micro-homologies and untemplated sequence have to be considered in
short soft clip cluster pairing as well. Short soft clip cluster pairing pro-
vides a mechanism to further increase Socrates' sensitivity. On testing
data, we found the sensitivity of the algorithm to increase by up to
15% compared with using cluster pairing only. The trade-off is a likely
increase in false positives, but the minimum support parameters can
be used to keep this under control. At the cost of reduced sensitivity,
short soft clip pairing may be ignored by setting the short soft clip pair
threshold to 0.

2.4 Implementation and algorithmic complexity

The main Socrates algorithm is implemented in Java. A driver script and
several utilities are implemented in python. Socrates includes a program
that identifies somatic SVs from matched-tumour normal pairs, which the
driver script can call. Additionally, it can also annotate whether predicted
break points overlap known repeats. Socrates is designed to run effi-
ciently on modern computing resources. The implementation supports
parallelization, scaling to any number of processors on a shared
memory machine and memory mapping of intermediate files, allowing
for efficient usage of memory and improved speed. During preprocessing,
all chromosomes are processed in parallel; in the clustering stage,
chromosomal segment pairs are processed in parallel with the space dis-
tributed evenly between processors.

The most complex stages of the algorithm are the cluster pairing and
short soft clip cluster pairing steps: both of them are bound by 0(N^),
where N is the size of the input data [comparing 0(N) clusters with 0(N)
reads]. However, the constants for these steps are small. The most time-
consuming stage of the algorithm is actually the cluster generation [which
is an 0(A^log AO search for matches for 0(N) new clusters in a sorted hst].
A detailed breakdown of the theoretical complexities of Socrates' differ-
ent stages and the implementation is presented in the Supplementary
Material.

2.5 Testing and simulated SVs

To assess Socrates' ability to detect structural variations and to compare
it objectively with other methods, we ran Socrates on simulated data for a
variety of types of genomic rearrangements. To achieve this, we de-
veloped a software tool that simulates random SVs of various types
and sizes. It divides the reference genome into bins of equal sizes and
creates one SV at a random location within each bin. Deletions, trans-
locations (either moving or duplicating a random segment into the bin),
inversions and tandem duplications are simulated with equal probability.
The SV feature size is also chosen randomly from small (100-200 nt),
medium (500-1000 nt), large (2000-10 000 nt) and extra large (20000-
100 000 nt). Additionally, tiny (5-30 nt) novel insertions were also simu-
lated. From the resulting somatic genome, we simulated reads using
SimSeq (John, 2010). These reads are then mapped to the reference
genome using Bowtie2 (using the -local flag). We compared Socrates
to BreakDancer (1.3) (Chen et al., 2009), CLEVER (2.0rcl) (Marschall
et aL, 2012), CREST (0.0.1) (Wang et al., 2011), DELLY (0.0.9) (Rausch
et aL, 2012), Pindel (0.2.4t) (Ye et al., 2009) and PRISM (1.1.6) (Jiang
et al., 2012). These methods sample a wide range of approaches in using
PE and/or SR evidence. The algorithms were typically run with default
parameters (for more details see Supplementary Section S5). It should be
noted that we used a consistent set of SV features to test each method. In
some cases, methods did not perform well because they were not

specifically designed for all SV types. We have noted this carefully
where it occurs.

We also applied Socrates to several real cancer datasets: an E/x-myc
mouse lymphoma, a human melanoma and prostate cancers sequenced
on an Illumina HiSeq platform using PE lOOnt reads. The E/x-myc mice
were maintained according to Peter Mac Animal Experimentation Ethics
Committee protocol E352. Matched normal (buffy coat) and melanoma
tissues were obtained from a consenting patient via Peter Mac Human
Research Ethics Committee protocol 10/02. Experimental validation is
described in the Supplementary Materials.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation on simulated SVs

To assess the performance of Socrates and several other meth-
ods, we simulated SV data and applied each tool. Simulated
events were treated as genomic intervals, and we classified a pre-
dicted SV as a true positive (TP) and recalled if both ends were
correct to within a small margin. For single-nucleotide resolution
methods (Socrates, Pindel, CREST and PRISM), this was set to
10 bp to allow for micro-homologies around the break point
sites, which unavoidably leads to loss of accuracy. For the PE
methods, BreakDancer and CLEVER, which do not have single-
nucleotide resolution in general, we allowed a tolerance of
250 bp. If there are redundant calls for a single event, only one
was counted as a TP, the remainder were talhed (see
Supplementary Table SI) and disregarded. Break points not
identified are counted as false negatives (FN), and all remaining
calls predicted by the algorithms as false positives (FP).

3.1.1 Escherichia coli simulations We first simulated rearrange-
ments in the E.coli reference genome (K12 strain). Escherichia
coli was chosen for initial simulations because it has a simple and
short (4.6 Mbp) genome, which should make the detection of
rearrangements and other variations easy. The parameters for
this simulation were llOkbp bins (42 events in total), 300 bp
DNA fragment size and a standard deviation of 30 bp. We re-
peated the experiment 10 times at each average coverage of 7.5,
15 and 30x.

Figure 2A (first and third panels) summarizes the precision (or
positive predictive value, defined by TP/(TP + FP)) and recall (or
sensitivity or true-positive rate, defined by TP/(TP + FN)) of
each method on a consistent set of simulated genomic rearrange-
ments in the E.coli genome. Increasing the coverage improves the
recall for most of the methods. Pindel and PRISM particularly
benefit from a higher read depth. Socrates performs well across
all coverage levels. The ranking of the algorithms stays consistent
across the coverage range, except for BreakDancer, which shows
more robust performance at low depth of coverage. The preci-
sion of several algorithms decreased with increasing sequencing
coverage. In particular, DELLY and PRISM have significantly
higher false-positive rates at 30 x compared with 7.5 x. The pre-
cision of CREST, Pindel and Socrates is constant at about 1 . We
speculate that the relatively high false-positive rates for DELLY
and PRISM were due to repeat events (and the misalignments
that they can cause) in the genome: they tend to be clustered in
focussed regions linking to various other loci in the genome. An
increase in coverage is likely to produce more spurious evidence
due to misalignments.

3.1.2 Human chromosome simulations We next tested Socrates
on simulated data that are more relevant to the problem of de-
tecting genomic rearrangements in a human cancer. A single
human chromosome (Chrl2) was selected as our target genome
to keep runtimes short. The choice was arbitrary; however,
Chrl2 has a reasonably representative GC content (40%) and
is interesting because it harbours a number of oncogenes such as
MDM2 and CDK4, which are commonly amphfied in some tu-
mours. The main shortcoming of selecting just one chromosome
is that this limits the number of paralogous and repetitive re-
gions, especially satelhte sequences, which frequently cause prob-
lems in real data. For this simulation, the bin size is L5 Mbp
(resulting in 89 variations per simulation), the read lengths are
100 bp and the fragment length to 300 and 30 bp standard devi-
ation. The simulation was run five times at each coverage level.

The results (Fig. 2A, second and fourth panels) show some
dramatic differences to those on the E.coli genome. All algo-
rithms, but particularly Pindel and PRISM, show lower recall,
which is expected, given the higher complexity of the reference
genome. A notable drop in recall is visible for the lowest cover-
age for CREST, Pindel and Socrates. The effect is weaker for
BreakDancer, DELLY and PRISM. BreakDancer in particular
holds its recall well with low coverage (and overall compared
with E.coli), making it the most sensitive algorithm at 7.5 x.

followed by DELLY and then Socrates. CREST, Pindel and
Socrates perform consistently at about 100% precision, and
PRISM follows the same trend as in E.coli. DELLY, however,
shows an average precision that is 40% lower than in E.coli
across all coverage depths. We attribute this to the increased
complexity of the genome in terms of repetitive sequence,
which seems to be the main source of false-positive calls for
DELLY.

3.1.3 Effect of SV type and size on false negatives The simula-
tions also provided us with an opportunity to investigate the
effect of SV size and type on false negatives across the different
methods. This provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses
of each algorithm. Here, we evaluate simulations based on
human Chrl2 at 30 x, but the results were comparable across
all experiments. Figure 2B shows recall for each of the algorithms
(see Supplementary Table S2 for FP, FN and total counts). We
show results in all categories for CLEVER, but it is only de-
signed for deletions and insertions. Evaluating the different vari-
ation types, we observe:

• Deletions: Socrates and PRISM show the best recall for
deletions with only 7 out of 117 deletions missed. CREST
and Pindel show a uniform FN pattern across the entire
range at roughly the same level. Deletions are CLEVER' s

best category. It achieves a recall of 82%. There is a signifi-
cant spike for large deletions being missed by CLEVER (it is
designed to detect insertions and deletions from 20-
50,000 bp). BreakDancer struggles with short deletions.

• Translocations: This category consists of both randomly
copied and moved genome segments. CLEVER and Pindel
were not designed to detect translocations. Unsurprisingly,
CLEVER finds no translocations, but Pindel does detect
some as insertions. The other algorithms were effective in
this category.

• Inversions: DELLY is the most effective tool to predict in-
versions. It misses only 2 out of 180 break points. Socrates is
competitive and misses only 7. PRISM has low recall for
short inversions. CLEVER is not designed to predict inver-
sions and finds none.

• Tandem duplications: DELLY, PRISM and CLEVER have
issues with short tandem duplications (shorter than the
simulated fragment length). This would be due to the map-
ping distance of paired ends not being evaluated as signifi-
cantly discordant. CREST and Socrates also show lower
recall for short duplications (as it is difficult for the aligner
to place reads within the sequence). BreakDancer shows the
best performance for tandem duplications (it misses only
two for the entire data)-despite having to rely exclusively
on paired end information, which can be difficult to inter-
pret for short feature sizes. Despite not explicitly handling
them, CLEVER performs well on large tandem duplica-
tions, particularly >100nt, treating them as insertions.
Pindel does not predict any features in this category.

Novel insertions of tiny size were also simulated. Because they
occur in only one size category (5-30 nt), we do not show these in
Figure 2. PRISM performs best for novel insertions and recalls
97% of them, followed by Pindel (93%) and Socrates (65%). The
other algorithms do not predict non-templated inserts at all —
most of the algorithms assessed here were not designed to predict
such features to begin with. We speculate that CREST fails at the
BLAT ahgnment stage, because small novel sequences compli-
cate the ahgnment results. BreakDancer is not able to detect a
significant aberration in insert sizes of PE reads at this small size
level, and this is just at the cusp of where CLEVER operates.
Socrates only comes third in this category but is the only algo-
rithm that actually outputs the inserted sequence, instead of just
flagging a break point.

3.1.4 Mapping algorithm dependency All the experiments dis-
cussed here are conducted with reads that were mapped with the
Bowtie2 (2.0.6). The -sensitive-local' option was used (which is
the default configuration for local alignments. The local ahgn-
ment mode is beneficial to obtaining good soft clipping results
around SVs). However, other aligners, such as BWA, can also be
used. We found BWA to be less sensitive to outputting soft
clipped reads when run with standard parameters. The recall of
Socrates in simulations on chrl2 with 15 x coverage drops
from >81 to 67%. Similarly, the recall achieved by CREST de-
creases from 68 to 61%. DELLY did not suffer from the same
decrease in sensitivity — ^probably due to its relying more on
paired end evidence than soft clipped reads. DELLY' s recall

remained the same or even increased shghtly when using BWA
mappings. BWA can be run in the more sensitive alignment
mode 'bwasw' that employs Smith-Waterman style alignments
for increased accuracy, but we found it too slow for a whole
genome scale.

3.1.5 Simulation results summary A range of types of SV detec-
tion algorithms were tested on randomly generated variations in
two organisms. Experiments were rephcated to ensure reprodu-
cibility of the results, and two different sequence simulators
[SimSeq and wgsim (data not shown)] were tested with consistent
results. The analysed algorithms can be broadly distinguished in
two classes: (i) methods that use and in some cases are primarily
reliant on fragment coverage (PE information) and (ii) methods
relying on sequence coverage (SR methods). Interestingly though
somewhat predictably, the results reveal that the sequence cover-
age-dependent algorithms (CREST, Pindel, Socrates) show a
larger decline in recall than the other tools as coverage decreases.
However, the specificity of the SR methods is better across the
experiments. We attribute this to the more stringent nature of the
evidence. SR methods require multiple reads to support an event
at (nearly) a single nucleotide location.

We were particularly interested in the comparison between
Socrates, CREST and Pindel. While distinct in their approaches,
they are most comparable in design (making use of sequence
coverage and soft clipping). The three methods are similar in
their overall precision and dependency of recall on coverage.
Socrates shows highest sensitivity between the three methods
throughout the experiments, which was a key focus of the algo-
rithm's design. CREST and Pindel are more conservative meth-
ods that potentially require more evidence to recall
rearrangement events (for example, CREST struggles with
tandem duphcation and inversion events at a size level that re-
duces the evidence available to the algorithms).

3.2 Application to tumour genome data

We next tested Socrates on several real cancer datasets. The first
was derived from the E/x-myc transgenic mouse, which spontan-
eously develops lymphomas (Adams et al., 1985). The structure
of the E/x-myc transgene is well described (Adams et al., 1985;
Corcoran et al., 1985). It consists of the c-myc gene in a pUC12
cloning vector with the E/x promoter of the IgH gene inserted
upstream and the <3>X174 bacteriophage inserted into the 3' UTR
(Fig. 3). We sequenced the genome of an E/x-myc tumour and a
DNA sample from the tail of the same mouse. The sequencing
data consisted of 100 nt paired end Illumina reads with coverage
of approximately 30 x for each sample and average fragment size
of 213 nt. The small fragment size means that about half of the
fragments have overlapping PE reads, and this may be an issue

for methods using PE information. We applied Socrates and
several other break point-detection tools to the E/x-myc data
(Table 1). Socrates detected the three known genomic fusions
(B, C and F), as did CREST and Breakdancer, while DELLY
did not detect any of these. Only Socrates and CREST were able
to identify the insertion site of the transgene into chrl9. This is a
novel finding. Socrates also identified several novel fusions that
were not previously known. None of the methods detected the
OX 174 insertion (Fig. 3, DE), because the <J>X genome was
omitted from the reference sequence. Overall, Socrates dramat-
ically outperformed the other methods on these data.

The main reason for the poor performance of the other meth-
ods is likely to be the unfortunately small average fragment size.
This means that the unsequenced region between reads is on
average only 13 nt long and that about half of the reads actually
overlap. This greatly reduces the usable coverage available to the
PE methods such as BreakDancer and the first stage of
DELLY's alignment, thus reducing their sensitivity. DELLY in
particular is not designed to detect inter-chromosomal fusions, so
it can only detect the break point on the cloning vector. The
complexity of break point H is particularly challenging for
the methods; it is promiscuous (sharing one coordinate with
the fusion to chrl9), and features a 10-bp novel insertion between
chrl5 and pUC12. Only Socrates is equipped to recover this
break point from the data.

We also applied Socrates to six prostate cancer tissue samples
and six matched whole-blood samples. Each sample was
sequenced to an average of 40 x coverage (100 bp paired end).
Tumour break point predictions were filtered using whole-blood
predictions to provide an average of 4360 break points per
sample using Socrates' most sensitive settings (1 cluster contain-
ing 1 long soft clip and 1 cluster containing 1 short soft clip). In
addition to DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing was performed
using benign tissue as a matched normal, with an average of 120
million reads per sample (100 bp paired end). Gene fusion can-
didates for each sample were determined using defuse by
McPherson et al (2011) on the RNA reads. On average, 315
candidate fusions were predicted for each sample. After filtering
with default parameters to enrich for high-confidence fusions
(McPherson et ai, 2011), defuse predicted 86 fusions per
sample on average. This is expected to contain a large number
of false positives. To improve performance, Socrates' break
points were used to determine true fusion events via support
by matched rearrangements in the DNA. As the RNA-based
fusions are determined using mature RNA transcripts, the
break point resolution is at exon level. To relate DNA break

points to RNA fusion points, we looked for break points be-
tween the fused exon, and the next annotated exon (unfused).
This resulted in an average of three fusions per sample that were
supported by both RNA and DNA. Interestingly, only 60% of
these validated fusions appeared in the high-confidence enriched
Hst produced using RNA and defuse filtering parameters. In this
case, Socrates provides the ability to find fusion events that
would not normally pass filtering. Furthermore, by using
Socrates predictions to filter fusions, we were able to detect
fusion events with as little as 4 reads support in the RNA.
This highlights the ability of Socrates to improve gene fusion
detection. Table 2 highlights the comparison results between
Socrates and defuse.

Socrates is designed to be highly sensitive. We have found this
to be extremely useful when integrating different sources of data
(e.g. the known and inferred fusions in the E/x-myc transgene
and RNA-seq data in prostate cancer). Using simulated data, we
also found it to be highly specific; however, on real tumour se-
quence data using its most sensitive settings without additional
filtering, it generates large numbers of predicted break points and
we assume these contain a large number of false positives. On the
E/x-myc tumour using the most sensitive parameter settings,
Socrates called >36000 break points. This is not an isolated
problem: DELLY predicted >385 000 and BreakDancer >5000.
In the absence of additional data or models, more stringent
thresholding of coverage is needed.

On a human melanoma, sequenced to 60 x coverage with
matched normal sequenced to 30 x, Socrates predicted about
105 000 SVs in the tumour when run using its most sensitive

settings (in comparison Delly predicted 150 000; BreakDancer
7800). Increasing the stringency to two long soft clips on each
side of the break point reduces the number of breakpoints to
6992, of which 678 were somatic. We randomly chose 10 break
points from these somatic events for validation. Seven were vali-
dated unambiguously by PCR and sequencing (Supplementary
Fig. S9); in one case the Sanger sequencing extended to just 1 bp
past the break point and the result is inconclusive, and in the
other two cases, further optimization to PCR conditions is
required. Sanger sequencing also validated short insertions of
untemplated sequence in between one of the break points that
was predicted by Socrates. DELLY recovered just two of the
validated break points, and BreakDancer recovered one.
Increasing the threshold to five long soft clips further reduces
the number of somatic events to 111, but three of the validated
break points are now missed. We are thus satisfied to work with
a threshold of two long soft clips. More careful control of false-
positive and false-negative rates awaits large scale unbiased val-
idation of break points. Short soft clips remain useful to more
accurately estimate the absolute support and the mutant allele
frequency (MAF) of break points.

It is interesting to examine the genomic context of the predicted
SVs. Table 3 shows the absolute and relative abundance of differ-
ent repeat classes overlapping the Socrates predictions. The labels
refer to repeats that contain either of the two cluster coordinates
(or are within lOnt of these). The results show that a dispropor-
tionate number of events are predicted in repetitive regions: only
13% of the somatic break points are not affected by repeats. This
number increases to 33% after basic filtering. Satellite repeats
make up a large proportion of the raw output and are reduced
to 10% after filtering. We also observed that break points in sat-
ellite regions and simple repeats tend to have low MAF, which are
inconsistent with expected copy number ratios. This may suggest
that they are false positives that arise due to stochastic events such
as chimeric sequence formation in these repetitive regions and
leads to the possibility of filtering based on MAF (see
Supplementary Material for further discussion).

3.3 Performance

Finally, we assessed the speed of Socrates. In the runtime experi-
ments presented here, we used up to eight threads in parallel for

the cluster-generation stage. All the experiments on Chrl2 were
run on different datasets to avoid caching advantages for one
algorithm over the other. The other two compared algorithms do
not offer ad hoc parallelization — CREST is run in parallel on all
the chromosomes on the E/x-myc tumour data, giving it 22
threads to compute. Table 4 summarizes the results. Socrates is
an order of magnitude or more faster than the other methods. In
terms of memory, all the algorithms are essentially bound by the
same theoretic complexity — the size of the input data. Socrates
uses slightly more than CREST and DELLY, but even on a
whole-genome scale analysis not more than a modern desktop
computer would provide.

4 DISCUSSION

Socrates is a new break point-detection method based on split
reads. It is fast and memory efficient. The main innovations in
Socrates are the automatic detection of micro-homologies and
untemplated sequences at fusion sites, and some of the details of
its implementation leading to its high speed. On simulated data,
Socrates recovers rearrangements across a broad range of types
and sizes. It is specific and highly sensitive. Its high sensitivity
makes it a powerful tool in the presence of additional informa-
tion, and we find it is complementary to more conservative meth-
ods. On real tumour data without additional information, we
find it impractical to run at its most sensitive settings, but it is
easily tuned. In the future, we plan to incorporate additional
types of evidence into the rearrangement prediction.

As NGS read lengths have increased, rearrangement predic-
tion methods have evolved from PE methods towards split read
and more recently hybrid methods. As this trend continues, it is
becoming more difficult to generate libraries of fragments that
are large enough. This is especially true with small quantities of
DNA and Formalin- Fixed Par afin- Embedded (FFPE) tumour
samples. Thus, we may see a resurgence of pure split read
approaches. These offer higher sensitivity over the RP-guided
hybrid approaches because they can analyze the smallest devi-
ations from the reference genome on a single nucleotide level. In
cancers, sensitivity is also key to detect, and make sense of, sub-
clonality. High sensitivity has been a key design principle behind
Socrates.
